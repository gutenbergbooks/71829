  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'> Since the publication of the last edition of this work the somewhat
varied topics treated of herein have never ceased to
occupy the attention of the Courts. Nor is it to be wondered at,
considering the diverse and complex forms of gambling which the
ingenuity, combined with the cupidity of mankind, is constantly
inventing, that our judges should from time to time be called upon
to adjudicate upon the legal attributes of the most recent devices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of legislative interference there has been but little. The Gaming
Amendment Act, which was passed to prevent the evasion of
the Act of 1845, by the interposition of an Agent, seems in reality
to have substituted another anomaly, seeing that while it has
abrogated the right of the Agent to recover reimbursement or
commission from his principal, it at the same time leaves unaffected
the right of the principal to recover winnings received by the
Agent on his behalf. The only other statute which has been
passed touching the subject, is the Infants’ Betting and Loans
Act, which may have its uses in protecting youths at the Universities,
Schools and Training Ships from unnecessary temptation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning now to the fresh material afforded by the Contents of
the Law Reports, it will be noticed that the course of business in
what are commonly known as “bucket shops” has been considered
in two cases in the Scotch Courts, <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>The Caledonian Railway</i>,
and <i>The Liquidator of the Universal Stock Exchange</i> v. <i>Mowat</i>,
with a view to ascertaining the identity of the transactions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>therein conducted with wager contracts. As to these two cases
the Authors have ventured to give reasons for suggesting that
they might have been decided the other way; and it is believed
that similar cases are pending in this country, so that it is not
unlikely that the question may soon be considered again. To
the keepers of these establishments the question has a more
serious importance than the mere rights and liabilities of parties
to a particular bargain, seeing, as it is pointed out in the Chapter
on Betting Houses, that if the transactions are wager contracts,
the Betting House Act applies, and it would be difficult to contest
the legality of a police raid.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Chapter on Lotteries the principal new case is that of
the Persian Investment Corporation, which establishes the
legality of companies formed to set up lotteries abroad.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is the Chapter on Betting Houses which has afforded
the greatest scope for enlargement. That old and much vexed
question “What is a place?” has several times of late been
before the Courts. But what is perhaps the question of the
greatest general interest under this heading, do Tattersalls and
the other betting clubs contravene the Act? has never yet been
raised in a practical form. At the same time the reader will find
some dicta set out in extenso which go far to confirm the views
previously expressed in these pages as to the distinction between
legal and illegal betting. A careful consideration of the very
difficult and complicated wording of the Act of 1853 has led the
Authors to a conclusion which may have some important practical
consequences on its enforcement, viz., that so far as betting on
credit goes, business conducted by correspondence does not infringe
the Act. Added to this we have the recent case of <i>Davis</i>
v. <i>Stephenson</i>, that in order to constitute an illegal ready-money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>establishment the actual receipt of money must be within the
establishment itself, the effect of which is considered in these
pages.</p>

<p class='c007'>One blank the Authors have endeavoured to fill. Great difficulty
seems constantly to be experienced by those who have to do
with the gambling laws, whether as judges, counsel or gamblers,
owing to the absence of a clear understanding of various legal
conceptions, such as “wager” and “lottery.” Authoritative
description or definition there certainly is none. To define is proverbially
hazardous and difficult. But an attempt is made in this
edition to analyse the component parts of these two very difficult
conceptions, thereby no doubt opening the door to numerous
criticisms, but it is hoped at the same time throwing out some
suggestions which may tend to prevent a confusion of ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few words on a more theoretical aspect of our gambling
laws. The reader will not fail to have been struck with the
frequent Parliamentary interpellations on the subject; many a
time has the Home Secretary been called upon to reply to
questions as to the intentions of the Government to introduce a
general scheme of revision. No doubt a semblance of justification
for this movement is afforded by a seeming want of impartiality
in the attitude of the law to different sorts and conditions of men.
The author of this work ventured not many years ago to offer to
the public a synopsis of this branch of our jurisprudence (<cite>Nineteenth
Century</cite>, November, 1889), in which an attempt was made
to show that laws in restriction of gambling, if they are to effect
their object, must in terms be so wide as to cover mere cases of
gambling for innocent recreation; that, in consequence, their
enforcement must largely be left to the discretion of the executive.
This is not the place for a discussion of this somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>broad and difficult question. The point is that it will behove
those who embark in this enterprise of supposed reformation to
formulate clearly first, the line of policy they would themselves
like to pursue; second, the extent to which interference is likely
to be tolerated by public opinion. Is all betting to be suppressed,
including that carried on at Tattersall’s and the clubs? If you
penalize playing “skittle-pool” for money in a public house,
are you also going to bring the sixpenny rubber of whist at
a West End club or private house under the ban of illegality?
If, as at present, you connive at the Derby “sweeps” in
Clubland, do you or do you not think it necessary to affect
consistency and repeal the law under which a publican is fined
for getting up a raffle for the Christmas goose? These are
questions which must be settled, and it may be compromised
before any reform of practical value can be carried through.
Mere consolidations of statutes and case law may facilitate
reference for practitioners, but they will not settle questions of
public expediency.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c014'><i>PART I.</i></h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>At Common Law.</div>

<p class='c007'>At Common Law wager-contracts were neither illegal nor
void; technically, they could, like any other legal contract,
be enforced by an action at law. The only obstacle in the
way of obtaining this remedy was that the Courts, grudging
the amount of time consumed in adjudicating upon what
were often exceedingly frivolous wagers, when other more
important causes were waiting for trial, took upon themselves
to postpone all actions of this kind until the rest of
the business had been disposed of; or, in the language of
Lord <span class='sc'>Ellenborough</span> in <i>Gilbert</i> v. <i>Sykes</i>,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> “until the Courts
had nothing better to do.” At the same time there were
certain kinds of wagers which could not be enforced, as
being of a mischievous, immoral tendency, or contrary to the
policy of the law. Among such were:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wagers illegal at Common Law.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) A wager which would give either party an interest in
interfering with the course of justice—<i>e.g.</i>, a wager on the
conviction or acquittal of a man charged with forgery.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a> On
the other hand, in <i>Jones</i> v. <i>Randall</i>,<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> it was held that there
was nothing illegal in a wager as to the result of an appeal
from the Court of Chancery to the House of Lords, it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>being in the power of the parties to influence the judgment
of the House, but <i><span lang="la">secus</span></i> if the bet had been made with a
noble lord or a judge.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Where the ascertainment of the fact or the event
would involve inquiries respecting the age or sex of third
persons or tend to make them objects of public curiosity.
Thus in <i>Da Costa</i> v. <i>Jones</i><a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> a wager as to the sex of a third
party was held to be illegal. In <i>Ditchburn</i> v. <i>Goldsmith</i><a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> a
wager that a certain woman would be delivered of a male
child before a certain date was held illegal on the ground
that neither party had any interest in the question; and this
in spite of the fact that the woman had herself challenged
inquiry on the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Eltham</i> v. <i>Kingsman</i><a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> two parties were proprietors of
certain carriages called “Fly by nights,” which they let to
hire at Cheltenham; the plaintiff laid a wager that a certain
person would go in his “Fly by night” to the assembly
room that evening. The Court were inclined to think this
would be illegal as tending “to subject a third party to
great inconvenience by exposing him to the importunities of
the proprietors of these vehicles; any person who has walked
through Piccadilly must be sensible that this is no small
inconvenience.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Where question concerned parties themselves.</div>

<p class='c007'>The law, however, was different where the question related
to a matter affecting either or both of the parties to the
wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Hussey</i> v. <i>Crickett</i><a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> the plaintiff and defendant were
dining one evening with seven other gentlemen at Furnival’s
Inn Hall. The two entered into a wager of a “Rump and
dozen” as to which was the elder. Each appointed one
gentleman to name a day on which the registers of baptism
should be produced, and to order a dinner for the “Rump
and dozen.” The two gentlemen named appointed a day
and ordered a dinner at the Albion in Aldersgate Street,
which was paid for by one of them, but the money was repaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>him by the plaintiff. Plaintiff won the bet, but the defendant
refused to attend the dinner. Plaintiff sued to recover
the amount he had paid.</p>

<p class='c007'>While for the defendant it was argued that the wager was
of a frivolous, immoral nature, and that at most plaintiff
could only recover his share of the entertainment, it was
replied for the plaintiff, that the wager relating to the parties
themselves was not void as if it related to a stranger; that
it was not of an immoral nature, as “it was for the public
benefit to promote conviviality and good humour;” that the
plaintiff’s loss of a share in a good dinner was not a frivolous
loss in the eye of the law. Indeed, it appeared from a quotation
from the Roman law, that that very universal system
of jurisprudence, while discouraging wagers in general,
recognised an exception where the terms of the wager bound
either party to provide any form of conviviality.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Mansfield, C. J.</span>, having confessed himself judicially
ignorant of the meaning of the term “Rump and dozen,”
parol evidence was admitted to explain this exceedingly
patent ambiguity. The term, as explained by the witnesses,
seemed at any rate to bring the case within the Roman law,
it being stated to signify “a good dinner and plenty of wine
for all present.” Upon this state of the facts, the judges,
while regretting that they had allowed the action to trouble
the Court at all, judicially decided that there was nothing
immoral in sitting down to a festivity! Therefore,
adjudging the wager to be valid, the Court, in spite of the
fact that defendant had not partaken of the dinner, ordered
him to pay for the whole of it. This case is a good illustration
of the kind of issues which the Courts had to try,
when wagers were enforceable.</p>

<p class='c007'>So again in <i>Good</i> v. <i>Elliott</i><a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> defendant bet the plaintiff
five guineas that one Susannah Tye had purchased a certain
wagon from one Coleman. This important controversy was
to be determined by two arbitrators, specially appointed, and
the sum of one shilling was deposited by each party to abide
the event. The majority of the Court held that the action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>would lie, seeing that it did not involve any enquiry that
would affect the peace of mind of a third party. <span class='sc'>Buller</span>, J.,
dissented, holding that any wager which conceded a third
party at all was bad. “I am of opinion that a bet on a lady’s
age, or as to whether she has a mole on her face, whether
she has a wart on her face (which is considered a nasty
thing) is void.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Wagers which would tend to improper discussion, <i>e.g.</i>,
concerning the amount of any branch of the Revenue.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) Wagers concerning any illegal sport or game, such as
a cock-fight,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> or hazard.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(5.) Where one party could determine the event in his
own favor,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> as a wager by an attorney’s clerk that he would
not pass his examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6.) Wagers were also illegal which gave either party an
interest in doing or procuring some unlawful act, as a wager
that Napoleon would be assassinated by a oration day,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> or which
might bias a person in the discharge of a public duty, such
as a wager between two voters as to the election of a member
for a county; but this was not the case where the wager
was made between two persons who were not voters for that
county.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wagers on abstract point of Law.</div>

<p class='c007'>(7.) A curious attempt was made in the case of <i>Henkin</i>
v. <i>Guerss</i><a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> to obtain the opinion of the Court on an abstract
question of law by means of a wager. Lord <span class='sc'>Ellenborough</span>
strongly reprehended the proceeding, and refused to try the
cause. The Court in Banco confirmed this decision: although
they said there was nothing immoral in this wager, yet they
considered it an impudent attempt to compel the Court to
decide an abstract question of law not arising out of circumstances
in which the parties had any interest. This reminds
us of one means by which the old Roman law was developed—viz.,
by the practice of pupils-at-law posing the advocates
in whose “chambers” they read with theoretical points of
law and recording their answers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>16 Car. II. c. 7.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The earliest statutory enactment restricting the power of
enforcing gaming debts in a Court of Law was 16 Car. II.,
c. 7. A great improvement had been introduced into the
breed of horses by the importation of a number of horses
from Tangier, which formed part of Queen Catherine’s
dowry, and racing under the patronage of Charles II.
was fast becoming a national pastime. As a natural consequence
the practice of betting increased at a proportionate
rate, and to such an extent as to interfere with individuals
pursuing their ordinary avocations. The statute, after
reciting that all games and exercises should not be used
otherwise than as innocent and moderate recreations, and
not as a calling or means of livelihood, and that young
people wasted their time and fortunes in the immoderate
use of the same, enacts:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) That if any person or persons of any degree or
quality whatsoever, at any time or times, shall, by any fraud
or shift in playing at or with cards, dice tables, tennis,
bowls, skittles, shovel-board, or in cock-fighting, horse-races,
dog matches, or other pastimes or games whatsoever,
or in bearing a share or part in the stakes, wagers, or
adventures, or in or by betting on the sides or hands of
such as do or shall play, act, ride or run as aforesaid, win,
obtain, or acquire to him or themselves, or to any other or
others any sum of money or valuable thing, shall forfeit
treble the sum or value of the thing won.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sect. 3. Any person who shall play at any game aforesaid,
or any other game other than with or for ready money,
or shall bet on the sides of them that do play thereat, and
shall lose any sum or sums of money, or other thing or
things so played for, exceeding the sum of £100 at any one
time or meeting, upon ticket, or credit or otherways, and
shall not pay down the same at the time when he or they
shall lose the same, shall not be compellable to make good
the same, but the contract or contracts for the same, and for
every part thereof, and all and singular judgments, statutes,
recognisances, mortgages, conveyances, occurrences, bonds,
bills, specialities, promises, covenants, agreements, and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>acts, deeds, and securities whatsoever given for the same
shall be void.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that this statute aims solely at (1)
cheating at play; (2) excessive gaming on credit. It does
not make wagering illegal so long as it is unaccompanied
by fraud, and the parties are at liberty to wager to any
extent provided they pay ready money.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next statute is 9 Anne, c. 14.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Anne, c. 14.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 1. All notes, bills, bonds, judgments, mortgages,
or other securities or conveyances whatsoever, given, granted,
drawn, entered into, or executed by any person or persons
whatsoever, where the whole or any part of the consideration
of such conveyances or securities shall be for any money,
or other valuable thing whatsoever won by gaming or
playing at any game whatsoever, or by betting on the
sides or hands of them that do or shall game at any of
the said games, or for repaying any money knowingly
lent for the purpose of gaming or betting as aforesaid,
or lent or advanced at the time and place of such play
to any person playing shall be void to all intents and
purposes, and that all property so encumbered shall devolve
on such person as would be entitled if the owner were
dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 2 any person, who at any time or sitting, by
playing at cards, dice tables, or other game, losing £10,
should pay the same, was entitled to recover the same by
action of debt, or in default of such person suing any person,
might recover treble the amount for the benefit of the poor
of the parish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 5 inflicts penalties on any person winning any
sum of money by any fraud, and on any person who should
win over £10 from any person or persons at one time or
sitting.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that this statute carried the restrictions
on private betting and gaming considerably further than the
Statute of Charles II. It prescribed additional penalties for
fraud; it made a great reduction in the test of excessive
gaming by substituting £10 for £100 as the maximum sum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>which a person might lose.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Further than this, it made it
penal to exceed the limit thus laid down, instead of merely
making the money irrecoverable. It has been held that the
offence under the statute was complete by the mere fact of
winning the moneys whether it were paid over or not.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Betting at games alone within statute.</div>

<p class='c007'>It should be observed that the statute does not deal with
wagering generally, but only with gambling and betting at
games, sports, or pastimes. In <i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i><a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> it was
decided that the games and pastimes aimed at by both
statutes are the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both these points have an important bearing on the law
as it exists at the present day, as will be seen when we come
to discuss the provisions of 5 &#38; 6 William IV. Before
dealing with the latter statute, it will be important to
notice a few points which were decided on the effect of the
two earlier statutes, otherwise the provisions of the Statute
of William IV. will not be intelligible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Games within the statute.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) As to the games dealt with, the Statutes of Charles
II. and of Anne are very general, speaking of “any games
whatsoever.” At the same time certain games have in
particular been expressly decided to be within the Acts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horse-racing.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus <i>horse-racing</i> is specifically mentioned in the Act of
Charles II., but not in that of Anne. However, in <i>Blaxton</i>
v. <i>Pye</i><a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> and in <i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i>,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> this species of pastime
was decided to be within the Statute of Anne, the “games”
mentioned in which statute were the same as those mentioned
in the Statute of Charles II. This subject will be
treated more fully when we come to the Statute 8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109. For a long time horse-racing was illegal, except
under certain conditions<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a>, but was early in this reign
legalised generally by 3 &#38; 4 Vict., c. 35. But although the
racing itself was made legal, that did not affect the provisions
of the statute against wagering.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wagers not legalised by 3 &#38; 4 Vict., c. 35.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus in <i>Bentinck</i> v. <i>Connop</i><a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> a race was to be run for stakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of £50 for each colt, to which the plaintiff and defendant
were subscribers, the defendant subscribing for three colts.
The plaintiff won the race, but the defendant disputing the
result refused to pay his stakes. Plaintiff sued him to
recover the amount he should have paid by the agreement.
It was admitted that the race itself was not illegal as it did
not infringe the Statute of George II., but <i>held</i> that the fact
of the race being legal did not make the contract enforceable—that
the contract was within the Statute of Charles II.,
a contract to pay a sum of money exceeding £100 lost at
horse-racing, and not paid down at the time; but that it
would have been recoverable (? from the stakeholder) if the
money had been deposited before the race. To the same
effect was the decision in <i>Shillito</i> v. <i>Theed</i>,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> that the Statute
of George II. had not repealed the provisions of the earlier
statutes as to wagering.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dog matches</i><a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> mentioned in the Statute of Charles II.
include coursing matches as well as dog fights.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Cricket</i><a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> is a game within the statute, so that a match for
£20 was illegal, even though not finished in one day. A bond
given to secure payment of a bet on a cricket match was void.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Foot-races</i>,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> even though against time. Of course whereever
any game is declared illegal of itself no sum of money
could be recovered as being won thereat. Thus in
<i>MacKinnell</i> v. <i>Robinson</i><a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> it was held that money lent for
the purpose of playing at hazard (which game, together
with ace of hearts, pharaoh, and basset, were declared illegal
by 12 Geo. II., c. 28) could not be recovered back, and that the
statute applied to gaming at private as well as public tables.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Cock-fighting</i><a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> seems to be illegal at Common Law, but no
doubt it is a game within the statute which speaks of games
generally.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Statute only applies to bet before or at time of race, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c007'>It should be noted that the statute only speaks of betting
on the sides of them that “do and shall” play.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In <i>Pugh</i> v. <i>Jenkins</i><a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> it was held that these words did not
apply to a wager between parties as to the accuracy of their
information as to the results after the race was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute also left unaffected any wager in a game for
a sum not over £10 and paid down at once, <i>e.g.</i>, by deposit
with a stakeholder.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Another question which arose on these statutes was
whether they avoided the contract itself or only the security.
In <i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Bland</i><a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Lord <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span> distinctly lays it down
that the contract might be good but the security void, and
in the same case it is pointed out that whereas the Statute
of Charles II. expressly avoids the contract, that of Anne
deals only with the security, and that probably all reference
to the contract in the latter statute was designedly omitted.
In <i>Macalister</i> v. <i>Haden</i><a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> it was held that an action would
lie on a wager for a sum under £10 on a race for over
£50, races for under that sum being at that time illegal by
the Statutes of George II. In <i>Barjean</i> v. <i>Walmsley</i><a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a> money
lent for betting purposes was held to be recoverable, as the
statute applied to the security only, and not to the contract.
However, the Court of Exchequer in the case of <i>Applegarth</i>
v. <i>Colley</i><a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> seem to have inclined to a different view as to the
effect of the statutes. It was argued by counsel in this case
that the Statute of Anne had avoided the security only, and
not the contract, but Baron <span class='sc'>Rolfe</span> in delivering the judgment
of the Court said that the Legislature had by the provisions
of the Statute 5 &#38; 6 William IV., c. 41, to which
fuller reference will be made hereafter, virtually decided the
question. “It is impossible,” he says, “to impute to the
Legislature an intention so absurd as that the consideration
should be good and capable of being enforced until some
security is given for the amount, and then by the giving of
the security the consideration should become bad.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The Statute of Anne in making securities “void to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>all intents and purposes” worked great injustice in the case
of innocent holders for value of bills and notes which had
originally been given for gaming transactions. Thus, in
<i>Shillito</i> v. <i>Theed</i><a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> the defendant had accepted a bill of
exchange for £185, drawn on him for the payment of a
wager on a legal horse-race. It was argued that as the
plaintiff was a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> indorsee of the bill for value, it was
not avoided in his hands. <span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span>, held that as the
statute avoided the security to all intents and purposes, not
even a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> indorsee for value could sue. It would seem,
however, that the statutes did not prevent an indorsee of a
bill or note originally accepted or made in payment of a
betting debt from suing the indorser on his indorsement, if
such indorsement were in consideration of a valid debt.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bower</i> v.
<i>Brampton</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus in <i>Bower</i> v. <i>Brampton</i><a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> the plaintiff sued as indorsee
of promissory notes given by defendant to one Church for
money knowingly advanced to defendant to game with at
dice, and Church indorsed them to the plaintiff for value
without notice—<i>Held</i> that he could not sue the defendant
as maker of the notes, as that would be a means of evading
the Act; but that he could sue Church on his indorsement.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Edwards</i> v.
<i>Dick</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Again, in <i>Edwards</i> v. <i>Dick</i><a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> the plaintiff sued as indorsee of a
bill of exchange drawn by the defendant on the acceptor in
payment of a betting debt, but indorsed by the defendant to
the plaintiff in payment of a valid debt. <i>Held</i>, that although
no action would lie against the acceptor either by the drawer,
or any one else claiming through him, still the defendant
could not set up as against the plaintiff the gaming consideration
as between himself and the acceptor.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>PART II.</i></h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>5 &#38; 6 Wm. IV., c. 41. Section 1.—Securities</div>

<p class='c007'>Such was the state of the law when the Statute 5 &#38; 6,
William IV., c. 41 was passed, which in effect provides
by section 1 that so much of the Statutes of Charles II. and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>deemed to be
given for
illegal consideration.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Anne which declared that any note, bill, or mortgage should
be absolutely void should be repealed, but that any note,
bill, or mortgage which were declared void by such statutes
should be deemed to have been made, drawn, accepted, given,
or executed for an illegal consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Section 2.—Acceptor can recover from drawer.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 2 it is enacted that if the person who gives
such note, bill, or mortgage should actually pay to the holder
of such security the money secured thereby, such payment
shall be taken to have been made for and on account of the
person to whom the security was originally given.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be noticed that the only alteration in the law
made by this statute is that instead of avoiding the securities,
given for gaming debts altogether, it declares that the
consideration for which they are given shall be illegal, or
in other words, it puts such securities on the same footing
as those which are given for an illegal consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have to consider—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. What transactions are within the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The legal result of a cheque, bill, &#38;c., being given for
an illegal consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. The remedy of a person who has given such an
instrument.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. Transactions within the statute.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Transactions within statute.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) The statute only applies to bets on games, which
term, as has been explained under the Statute of Anne,
includes horse races. It must be remembered that the
decisions under the latter statute apply to the present statute,
except so far as the present statute has expressly altered the
provisions of the earlier statute.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bets after race not within statute.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) It was decided in <i>Pugh</i> v. <i>Jenkins</i><a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a> that the statute of
Anne only applied to bets either before or during the game
or race, the words being “do and shall play.” It often
happens that, immediately after the horses have passed the
post, people bet on the correctness of their judgment as to
whether a horse has won or got a place. It would seem,
therefore, that a note or cheque given in payment of such a
bet would not be given for an illegal consideration, though,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of course, as in <i>Fitch</i> v. <i>Jones</i><a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, the consideration would be
void. The difference between the two will be explained
hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Statute did not apply to stakes under £10 deposited.</div>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The Statute of Anne did not apply where the stakes
for under £10 were deposited before the race by the competitors.
This point was settled in the well-known case of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Applegarth</i>
v. <i>Colley</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i><a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a>, to which some allusion has already
been made, but which is specially important, not only as an
authority on the construction of the earlier Statutes of
Charles II. and Anne, but also showing the extent to
which those statutes were incorporated into 5 &#38; 6 William
IV., c. 41. The plaintiff was a subscriber to a horse-race
for which the stakes were £2 with £15 added; the whole
sum subscribed amounted to less than £50. The plaintiff
won the race and sued the defendant with whom the
money had been deposited to recover the stakes. The
defendant pleaded the above facts as a defence, and the
plaintiff demurred. The first point raised by the plea
was, that as the race was for under £50 it was illegal under
the Statutes of George II.’s reign; but as all horse-racing
had been held to be legalised by 3 &#38; 4 Vict., c. 5, this
plea could not be supported. But it was also argued that
the plea disclosed a good defence, on the ground that it
was a suit to recover a sum of money over £10 won by
horse-racing, and so could not be maintained by virtue
of the Statutes of Charles II. and Anne. Against this it
was argued that the Statute of Anne only avoided the
security given to repay a debt, and not the contract itself.
The judgment of the Court, which was delivered by Baron
<span class='sc'>Rolfe</span>, established the following propositions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>a.</i>) That however the law may have stood under the
earlier statutes with respect to the avoidance of the contract,
the Legislature had virtually decided the question by passing
the Statute 5 &#38; 6 William IV., c. 41, it being “impossible
to impute to the Legislature an intention so absurd as that
the consideration should be good and capable of being
enforced until some security is given for the amount, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>that then the consideration should become bad.” That,
therefore, since the passing of this statute, all <i>contracts for
the payment of money</i> won at play must be taken to be
avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b.</i>) That in the present case the stakes having been
deposited with a stakeholder before the race, there was no
contract for the payment of money lost at play, within the
meaning of the Statute of Anne: that statute must be read
in conjunction with that of Charles II., and was intended to
prevent gaming on credit, and not to interfere with playing
for ready money.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>c.</i>) That plaintiff was not precluded from recovering by
sections 2 and 5 (according to which the loser of £10 or
upwards at any one time or sitting may recover it back, and
the winner at any one time or sitting of over £10 is subject
to heavy penalties) on the ground that by a fair construction
of the statutes, the penalties inflicted on “the winner,”
&#38;c., only applied where there was a corresponding “loser”
of over £10, and in this case the loss of each person was
£2 only. It was, however, the Court added, unnecessary to
decide that point, as the plaintiff was at any rate entitled
to recover the £15, which had been subscribed by a stranger
by way of prize to the winner; and the defendant’s plea
was bad as having covered too much.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen that the decision leaves untouched the
question as to the right to recover where the stakes amount
to £10 each; but it would seem that this question could
now only be of importance where a bill or note had been
given to the winner for the amount, and the winner sues
on that instrument; otherwise any such case would now
fall under the Statute 8 &#38; 9 Vict. c. 109 (as to which <i>see
post</i>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Thorpe</i> v. <i>Coleman</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Thorpe</i> v. <i>Coleman</i><a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a> an action was brought to recover
£10, a wager on the Derby. It was sought, in argument
for the plaintiff, to upset the decision in <i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i>
that the statute applied to the contract as well as to the
security. <span class='sc'>Tindal, C. J.</span>, in giving judgment, said that as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to the sums of £10 or upwards the contract was clearly
not enforceable, seeing that section 2 of the Act of Anne
enabled the loser, who had paid the sum of £10, right to
recover it by action. He expressly reserved the question, as
to whether the statutes affected bets under £10, that is
whether the contracts themselves were void as well as the
securities given for payment. But to enable a person to
recover what could immediately be recovered back from him
would only encourage circuity of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems, therefore, that the statutes did not apply, provided
(1) that the stakes were deposited before the event
came off, (2) and that they were not more than £10 each.
This view of the matter was adopted in <i>Emery</i> v. <i>Richards</i>,<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
which was an action to recover a stake of 10s. from a stakeholder
deposited to abide the event of a wager upon a foot-race.
It was held that neither party could revoke the
stakeholder’s authority, as it was a valid wager. “It was
not gaming on ticket, because here the money was parted
with, nor is it excessive gaming within the Act,” it being
for a sum under £10.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not be forgotten that under the present state of
the law (as will appear hereafter) any wager would be void
as an agreement, and the stake could be recovered from the
stakeholder by the depositor. But the point of importance
under the Statute 5 &#38; 6 William IV., c. 41, is whether a
wager when forming the consideration for a bill of exchange
would be an illegal consideration and so a defective title.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cheque for gaming debts incurred abroad.</div>

<p class='c007'>It does not appear to have been decided how far a cheque
or promissory note given for a gaming debt incurred abroad
can be sued upon in this country, provided they be not void
or illegal in the country where they are incurred. It would
seem clear that any such cheque would not be given for an
illegal consideration within the Statute of William IV.
The Statute of Anne, on which that statute is founded,
containing as it does penal provisions, could only have
reference to gaming in this country. The case of <i>Quarrier</i> v.
<i>Coulston</i><a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a> seems at first sight an authority for the suggestion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>that an action on such a cheque could be maintained. In
that case, however, the greater part of the sum for which the
I O U was given was for money lent for gaming at the
public Baden gaming tables, the presumption being that
such gaming was legal: while the small balance was made
up of money won at cards in sums of less than £10 at each
sitting; so that the transaction would not have been illegal
under the Statute of Anne. On principle it would seem
that the <i><span lang="la">lex loci contractus</span></i> would govern the matter, <i>i.e.</i>, the
place where the gaming debt was incurred. But later on
in this work, p. 68, it is suggested that the words of section
18 of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, “no action shall be brought,” etc.,
introduce the <i><span lang="la">lex fori</span></i>. If an action on a wager made abroad
cannot be maintained it is difficult to see how an action
could be brought on a cheque given in respect of such
wager.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Loans for gaming purposes.</div>

<p class='c007'>(5.) The Statute of Anne avoided all securities for money
knowingly lent for gaming or betting or advanced at the
time and place of such gaming to any person so gaming or
betting, or that should during such gaming or betting so
play or bet. The following propositions would seem to
explain the law as to money lent for gaming purposes.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>a.</i>) As already explained the statute avoids the
contract as well as the security.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>b.</i>) It only applies to money lent for gaming or
betting on games and horse races.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>c.</i>) Therefore money lent to a person knowing that
he is going to apply it in such ways cannot be recovered;
this seems to be recognised in <i><span lang="la">ex parte Pyke</span></i>.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a> The
statute makes it illegal.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>d.</i>) The words of the statute seem to establish an
irrebuttable presumption that money advanced during
play (including, of course, during a race meeting) to
any one who at the same sitting or meeting (the words
“during such play” seem to point to this) should take
part in such games or betting was knowingly advanced
for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>(<i>e.</i>) The statute does not apply to money advanced
to pay debts already incurred.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Money lent for paying a gaming debt.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i><span lang="la">ex parte Pyke</span></i><a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> a question arose as to the right to
recover money lent to enable the borrower to pay off a
gaming debt. A employed B as his agent to back horses
for him, which horses lost. B at A’s request paid the bets
in the settlement at Tattersall’s, taking A’s promissory
notes for the amount. A became bankrupt and B claimed
to prove in the bankruptcy, not upon the notes, but for the
money thus advanced. The registrar allowed the proof, and
the trustees appealed. The Statutes of Anne and William IV.
apply not only to money won by gaming, but to securities
given to repay “any money knowingly lent or advanced for
such gaming or betting as aforesaid, or lent or advanced at
the time and place of such play, to any person or persons so
gaming or betting as aforesaid.” It was argued for the
trustee that this was a debt for an illegal consideration
within the above quoted words, as according to <i>Applegarth</i>
v. <i>Colley</i> the statute applied to the contract, and not only to
the security, also that on the authority of <i>Higginson</i> v.
<i>Simpson</i> the whole transaction was in the nature of a wager.
The Court held that as the money had been advanced after the
bets had been made, it could be recovered: but that it would
have been different had it been lent with a view to gaming.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>f.</i>) The statute does not apply to money lent for
gaming abroad<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>g.</i>) Of course money advanced to enable a person to
play any unlawful game as hazard, as in <i>McKinnell</i> v.
<i>Robinson</i><a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a> or for unlawful gaming within 17 &#38; 18 Vict.,
c. 38, s. 4, cannot be recovered<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Test of illegality.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is sometimes difficult to determine whether a transaction,
to some extent mixed up with an illegal transaction,
is so inseparable from it as to be within the statute.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Simpson</i> v. <i>Bloss</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Simpson</i> v. <i>Bloss</i><a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a> it was laid down that the real test
whether a demand connected with an illegal transaction is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>capable of being enforced at law, was, whether plaintiff requires
any aid from the illegal transaction to establish his
case. The plaintiff laid an illegal wager with B in which
the defendant assumed a part. The plaintiff won. Plaintiff,
expecting that B would pay by a certain time, advanced to
defendant his share of the winnings to which he was entitled
by his agreement by plaintiff. B became insolvent and
never paid the bet.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Held</i> that as plaintiff could not establish his case without
the aid of the illegal wager, he could not recover.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Liability of partners in illegal firm to account.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Sharp</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a> the Court drew a distinction between
enforcing an illegal contract, and enforcing a subsidiary contract
arising therefrom. They held that although a partnership
might have been formed to carry out an illegal object
which the Court would not aid in effecting, yet one partner
who has received moneys which have been realised in the
illegal business, cannot set up the illegality in answer to a
claim by his co-partner for an account.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this case was subject to some unfavourable criticism
by the late Master of the Rolls in the case of <i>Sykes</i> v.
<i>Beadon</i>.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> This was a case of a society not registered under
the Companies Act, which the Master of the Rolls held was
illegal as infringing that Act, though his decision on that
point was overruled by the Court of Appeal in <i>Smith</i> v.
<i>Anderson</i>.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>His lordship also was of opinion that it was illegal as
infringing the Lottery Acts. The object of the suit was to
have the trusts of the society administered by the Court.
But his lordship held that as the society was illegal, it was
impossible that its objects could be carried out by the Court.
Even supposing a suit were framed for the object of putting
an end to the society and dividing the assets, he thought it
very doubtful whether the reasoning in <i>Sharp</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> was
correct, that because an illegal transaction is closed, that
therefore a Court of Equity is to interfere in dividing the
proceeds of the illegal transaction.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>In the case of <i>Beeston</i> v. <i>Beeston</i>.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Plaintiff had paid
money to defendant to bet with on their joint account,
plaintiff to receive a share of the winnings. Defendant won,
and gave plaintiff a cheque in payment of his share. The
cheque was dishonoured, and plaintiff sued defendant on it.
It was urged for the defendant that it was a contract by way
of gaming, and that the cheque was given to secure the
moneys won thereby, and was therefore a void security, both
under 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, and 5 &#38; 6 William IV., c. 41.
The Court held that the plea was bad and the plaintiff was
entitled to recover on the ground that the consideration for
the cheque was entirely distinct from the wagering. <i>Sharp</i>
v. <i>Taylor</i> was cited with approval as showing that one
partner cannot set up the illegality of a transaction against
a co-partner and thereby retain the whole of the profits
arising from that transaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was remarked by <span class='sc'>Pollock, B.</span>, that the two statutes
quoted only applied to contracts and securities as between
the parties to the wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case will be referred to again when we come to deal
with the rights of principal and agent;<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and in the Chapter
on Gaming Houses the question of illegal partnership is
fully discussed (p. 162).</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The consequences of an instrument being given for an
illegal consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Law as to illegal consideration.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Bills and notes.</div>

<p class='c007'>The general rule is that if A accepts a bill drawn upon
him by B, or gives him a promissory note, for an illegal
consideration, the instrument no doubt is entirely void as
between A and B, so that the latter cannot sue the former
upon it; still if B transfers the instrument by endorsement
or otherwise to C, who takes without notice that it was
originally given for an illegal consideration, and gives value
for it, C may sue all the prior parties and recover upon it.
The chief difference that such illegality makes to C is, that
a presumption is raised that C is the agent for the original
holder, <i>i.e.</i>, that the indorsement to him is presumed to be
merely a means of evading the law and enforcing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>originally illegal contract.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Burden of
proof is on
transferee.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Consequently the rule is that
the burden of proof lies on the transferee of showing that
he took the instrument <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i>, <i>i.e.</i>, without notice of the
illegality, and that he gave value for it. Moreover, the
illegality would affect the interests of a transferee if at the
time of the transfer the bill were overdue. Before the late
Bill of Exchange Act, it was commonly said that an indorsee
of an
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Overdue bill.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
overdue bill took it subject to all the equities attaching
to the bill. Thus, if a bill were obtained from the acceptor
by fraud or undue influence, or given for an illegal consideration,
those were equities between the original parties
which would prevent the instruments being enforced as
between them; but would not affect a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> transferee
for value. The fact, however, of a bill being overdue would
be sufficient notice of the infirmity to prevent his being a
<i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> holder.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>45 &#38; 46 Vict.,
c. 61.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The new Bill of Exchange Act<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a> leaves
the law practically unchanged, excepting in phraseology.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“Holder in
due course.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For “<i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> holder” is substituted the expression “holder
in due course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 29, the holder in due course is defined to be
(1) a person who takes a bill not overdue and without notice
of dishonour, if any; (2) and takes it in good faith and for
value, and at the time the bill was negotiated to him he
had no notice of any defect of title of the person who
negotiated it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The expression “defect of title,” which occurs in this
section, is substituted for the older and more cumbrous one
of “equity attaching,” &#38;c. By section 29, the title of a
person who negotiates the bill is “defective” when he
obtains the bill or acceptance thereof by fraud duress (“force
or fear” in Scotland), or other unlawful means, or for an
illegal consideration (which includes a gaming debt).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Defect of title shifts burden of proof.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 30, the holder is presumed to be a holder in due
course until the contrary is proved; but in that event the
burden of proving that value has been given for the bill and in
good faith, is shifted on to the holder. See <i>Tatham</i> v. <i>Hasler</i>.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Overdue bill.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>By section 36, an overdue bill is negotiated subject to all
defects of title affecting it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result of these enactments, stated in the language
of the law at the present day, seems to be shortly as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c017'>(1.) A bill or note accepted or made for a gaming
debt (such as is dealt with by the Statute of Anne) is
subject to a defect in title.</p>

<p class='c017'>(2.) If such instrument be overdue, any transfer is
made subject to such defect.</p>

<p class='c017'>(3.) The holder must in all cases, to entitle himself
to sue when once the illegality has been proved, show
that he took the bill or note <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> and for value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Absence of consideration not a defect.</div>

<p class='c007'>As will be seen by reference to any work on Bills of
Exchange, mere absence of consideration does not constitute
a defect of title: consequently the indorsee for value of an
overdue accommodation bill can recover on the bill from
the acceptor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nor is a void consideration.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Fitch</i> v. <i>Jones</i><a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> the question was raised as to whether a
consideration not illegal but merely void by Act of Parliament
constituted an “equity.” It was an action on a promissory
note by the indorsee against the maker. Defendant
pleaded that the note was given by him to one C in payment
of a debt on the amount of hop duty in 1854, the bet being
made since the passing of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109. It was not
an illegal consideration within 5 &#38; 6 William IV., as the
bet was not on a game or pastime. A question was raised at
the trial as to whether the plaintiff had given value for the
note when endorsed to him. The judge directed the jury
that the onus was on the defendant of proving that no value
was given. On this ruling the substantial question in the
case was raised before the Court, viz., whether the voidness
of the consideration had the same effect as illegality, in
throwing the burden on to the indorsee (<i>i.e.</i>, the plaintiff)
of showing that he took the note for value and without
notice. The Court held that the consideration was merely
void by 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, and not illegal; and that this had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>not the effect of raising the presumption that the plaintiff
took the note without value.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Lilley</i> v. <i>Rankin</i><a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a> the same ruling was applied to
cheques given in payment in respect of gambling transactions
in stocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Questions have sometimes arisen upon what amounts to
notice of the illegality, which, as has been seen, a holder
of a bill is sometimes called upon to disprove. On this
subject reference should be made to works on Bills of Exchange.
It seems that there need be no express or precise
notice, but that any circumstance of suspicion which ought
to have put the holder upon enquiry is sufficient. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What notice
is sufficient.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus, in
<i>Soulby</i> v. <i>Portarlington</i>,<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> defendant was acceptor of a bill for
£1,000, payable to one Aldridge, who was keeper of a gaming
house, for money lost at play. It was endorsed to one
Brooke, who discounted it with Soulby &#38; Co., wine merchants,
the plaintiffs in the action, with whom Brooke, a
retail wine dealer, had dealings. The plaintiffs advanced £700
on the bill, agreeing to deliver £300 in wine. Soulby commenced
an action in Ireland on the note. The defendant
instituted a suit in the Court of Chancery in England to
restrain the plaintiffs from proceeding with the action, on the
ground that it was given for a gambling debt. <i>Held</i> that the
facts were such as to put the plaintiffs on enquiry as to what
the origin of the bill was, especially as it was not denied by
the plaintiffs in their affidavits that they knew that Aldridge
was the keeper of a gambling house. That the Court had
clearly jurisdiction to restrain the plaintiffs (who were
resident in England) from proceeding with their action in
Ireland, and also to order the bill to be delivered up to be
cancelled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hawker</i> v. <i>Hallewell</i>, 3 Findley. 3 Sm. &#38; G.</div>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Hawker</i> v. <i>Hallewell</i><a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> is a good illustration of
cases where the transferee will not be held to have taken
with notice, and also of cases where the transferor by his
conduct estops himself from alleging the illegality of the
original consideration. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Assignee of
bond.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In <i>Hawker</i> v. <i>Hallewell</i><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> the plaintiff
gave a bond in 1841 to one Jenkins to secure repayment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>a betting debt; at least, this was assumed for the purposes of
argument, though the evidence did pot prove it. Jenkins
assigned the bond and a policy of assurance to a bank.
Plaintiff, in June, 1848, made a proposal to the bank that
the bond and policy should be given up, and that the existing
debt, together with a further advance, should be secured
by mortgage on some reversionary property of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff alleged that he had given notice to the bank
that the bond was given for a gaming debt. The plaintiff,
in 1853, assigned all his property to trustees for the benefit
of his creditors, and now filed a bill to administer the trusts.
The Chief Clerk disallowed the claim of the bank. The
plaintiff contended that the bond was void under 9 Anne,
c. 14, which had not been repealed by 5 &#38; 6 William IV.,
so far as regards bonds. 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, which repealed
so much of the Statute of Anne as was not repealed by 5 &#38;
6 William IV., was not retrospective. The Vice-Chancellor
decided on the facts that the bank had taken the bond without
notice of the original consideration. He also held that,
although the operative part of the Statute of William IV.
only applied to negotiable securities, yet the recitals included
bonds and securities of every kind; so that an obligee was
within the equity of the statute, and that, on the principle
of Equity follows the Law, a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> assignee of a bond
for valuable consideration would be treated in the same way
as a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> holder of a bill of exchange. But there was a
further ground on which his honour decided in favour of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Estoppel of
obligor.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
bank—that the plaintiff by his proposal in 1848 had held
out to the bank that the bond was a valid security and that
on the principle of <i>Pickard</i> v. <i>Seears</i><a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> he could not be heard
to set up its invalidity. This latter point seems to be the
same as that on which <i>Edwards</i> v. <i>Dick</i><a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a> was decided,
viz., the ordinary principle of estoppel—that if one person by
his acts or representations induces another person to believe
in the existence of a certain state of facts, and acting on
such belief to enter into a contract with him, he cannot be
heard to say that those facts do not exist.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pleading illegality.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Of course, the burden of proving the illegality of the consideration
lies on the person who sets it up, on the principle
that he who alleges the affirmative must prove it. This was
clearly recognised by the Court in <i>Fitch</i> v. <i>Jones</i>.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> By the
Rules of Court, 1883, facts showing illegality either by
Statute or Common Law must be specially pleaded. It
seems, too, at any rate under the old system of pleading, that
it was not sufficient for defendant to plead a fact showing
illegality, but he must also aver that plaintiff gave no value
for the bill, although the illegality once established would
raise a presumption to that effect.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Admission in pleadings enough to shift burden of proof.</div>

<p class='c007'>It seems that in order to throw the burden of proof on to
the shoulders of an indorsee, it was not sufficient that the
illegality should be admitted on the pleadings; it must be
proved in evidence. Thus in <i>Edmunds</i> v. <i>Grove</i><a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a> in an action
by the indorsee against the maker of a note. <i>Plea</i>, that the
note was made for a gaming debt, and indorsed to plaintiff
without consideration and with notice. To this plaintiff
replied denying the notice and absence of consideration without
denying the illegality. <i>Held</i>, that although the pleadings
by not putting in issue the illegality admitted it, still that
had not the effect of throwing the burden of proof on to the
plaintiff that he took without notice and for good consideration.
Presumptions or inferences of fact could only
be drawn by the jury from facts proved before them. The
issues only, and not the pleadings, were before the jury.
But now by the Bill of Exchange Act, s. 30 (2) it is
sufficient that the illegality should be <i>admitted</i> or
<i>proved</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The exact nature of the consideration should be stated.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is always advisable, particularly where a plea of
illegality is set up, to state fully the circumstances under
which the contract or security is affected with illegality.
Thus in <i>Bolton</i> v. <i>Coghlan</i><a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a> plaintiff sued as indorsee of a
note made by defendant. The latter pleaded that it was
made for money lost at play.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The evidence showed that defendant lost money at play to
one Aldridge, and accepted a bill for the amount drawn by
Aldridge. Aldridge indorsed to Knight. It was then
agreed between defendant and Aldridge that defendant
should in substitution for the bill give Knight his note of
hand for the amount Knight indorsed to plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Held</i> that as the plea implied that the note was originally
given for a gaming debt, whereas it was really only a substituted
agreement, the defendant should not be allowed to take
plaintiff by surprise and go into evidence of the subsequent
agreement.</p>

<p class='c007'>But under the Rules of Court the judge at the trial has
power to allow amendments in the pleadings upon terms as
to costs or otherwise.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Action against indorser.</div>

<p class='c007'>The statute only affects the liability of the acceptor of a
bill or maker of a note given for a gaming debt. It does not
prevent the indorsee suing the indorser where the indorsement
was, as between them, for a legal consideration: the statute
leaves the law, as settled in <i>Edwards</i> v. <i>Dick</i>,<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> untouched.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deeds for illegal consideration.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Another consequence of the consideration being
declared illegal is, that although the absence of consideration
does not affect a deed, an illegal consideration avoids it. It
seems, too, from <i>Hawker</i> v. <i>Hallewell</i>,<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a> that a bond is within
the equity of the Statute of William IV. For the general
authorities on the subject of Bonds and Deeds given for an
illegal consideration, the reader should refer to Smith’s
Leading cases under <i>Collins</i> v. <i>Blantern</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Contracts divisible and indivisible.</div>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Again, if part of the consideration for which an
instrument is given be illegal, the whole is vitiated.</p>

<p class='c007'>But here a distinction must be drawn between contracts
that are divisible and those that are indivisible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Hay</i> v. <i>Ayling</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Hay</i> v. <i>Ayling</i><a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a> is an example of an indivisible contract.
In 1848 the defendant owed one A £100 on a bet on a
horse-race. A was also indebted to the plaintiff. A by
arrangement drew a bill on the defendant for the amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>which the defendant accepted and was indorsed by A to
plaintiff. The bill was dishonoured and the plaintiff at
defendant’s request gave him further time and took from
him a renewed acceptance, knowing at that time that the
original acceptance was given for a gaming debt. <i>Held</i>
(1) That the fact of there being an additional consideration
for the bill sued upon (<i>i.e.</i> the giving of time) would not be
an answer to the plea of illegality, as illegality in any part
of the consideration is sufficient to avoid the contract.
(2) That the plaintiff having notice of the illegality could
not recover as a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> holder. (3) That the bills were
avoided not by 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, s. 18 (which statute, as
we shall see hereafter, only avoids wagering contracts
without making them illegal), but by 5 &#38; 6 William IV.,
c. 41. It must at the same time be admitted that this view
of the matter was not adopted in <i>Bubb</i> v. <i>Yelverton</i>.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Bubb</i> v.
<i>Yelverton</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This
was a summons in an administration suit to determine the
legality of a claim on a bond given by the Marquis of
Hastings. Having got into racing difficulties, and being
unable to pay his debts, his creditors threatened to bring the
matter before the Jockey Club and have the Marquis posted
at Tattersall’s as a defaulter. To avoid this the Marquis
arranged to secure the payment of certain sums to his
creditors by bonds with sureties. Lord <span class='sc'>Romilly</span> decided in
favour of the claims, on the ground that the consideration
for the bonds was not so much the existence of a betting
debt, but the forbearance of the creditors to bring the matter
before the Jockey Club. It is, however, submitted that the
bonds were void as having been given partially for an illegal
consideration, viz., a series of gaming debts. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Contract
divisible.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the other
hand, as an instance of a divisible contract, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Clayton</i> v.
<i>Dilley</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in <i>Clayton</i> v.
<i>Dilley</i><a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a> the defendant authorised plaintiff to bet for him at
the Epsom races. Plaintiff made two bets of £100 each,
which were illegal under the Statute of Anne, and another
of £5, which was admitted to be legal; all of them were
lost, and paid by the plaintiff, who sued to recover from
defendant. The Court held that he could recover the £5,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>but not the 200. It is obvious the commissions to make
the different bets were separable.</p>

<p class='c007'>So in <i>Lyne</i> v. <i>Siesfield</i><a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a> a broker sued his client for money
paid to his use, to which defendant pleaded that the money
was paid in respect of differences on certain contracts by way
of gaming relating to the public funds and railway shares.
<i>Held</i>, that as the plea was bad in parts, and had been united
in one, the whole was bad.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remedy of person who has given bond or note, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c007'>III. It seems that a person who has given a bond, bill, or
note to secure payment of a gambling debt, can bring an
action in the Chancery Division to have the security delivered
up to be cancelled, and also under the whole practice could
obtain an injunction against suing at law to recover upon
it.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a> But since the Judicature Act,<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a> no proceeding in the
High Court can be restrained by injunction, though probably
this does not affect an injunction against suing in any other
court. In some of the cases referred to, the action restrained
was brought in an Irish Court; in such a case probably an
injunction would lie even since the Judicature Act. In the
case of the acceptor of a bill or maker of a note being compelled
to pay the amount to a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> holder, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Section 2
of Act.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
section 2 of
the Act provides that he can recover from the drawer or
payee for money “paid for and on account of the person to
whom the bill was originally given upon such illegal consideration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Gilpin</i> v. <i>Clutterbuck</i><a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> the plaintiff had been compelled
to pay an indorsee of a bill which he had accepted in payment
of a gaming debt; and it was held that he was entitled
by the statute to sue the original payee in an action of
“assumpsit,” and was not bound to sue in “debt under the
statute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bill bore interest on the face of it. <i>Held</i> that plaintiff
was entitled to recover the interest from the defendant as well
as the principal sum. <i><span lang="la">Secus</span></i> if the bill does not on the face
of it provide for the payment of interest.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lynn</i> v. <i>Bell</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>In <i>Lynn</i> v. <i>Bell</i><a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a> the plaintiff, in payment of certain bets
on horse-races, gave to the defendant three cheques on the
plaintiff’s bankers, payable to bearer; two of these were
indorsed by the defendant and by his indorsees to third parties,
and a third was indorsed by the defendant alone in payment
of a betting debt; all were eventually paid by the plaintiff’s
bankers. Plaintiff sued the defendant to recover under this
section the amount of the three cheques. It was urged for the
defendant (1) That the cashing of the cheques by the plaintiff’s
bankers was not a payment of a bill or note within the
statute. (2) That he was entitled to set off the amount of a
cheque drawn by one A in his favour, and indorsed by him to
the plaintiff in payment of a betting debt, and for which the
plaintiff had received cash at A’s bankers. <i>Held</i> (1) as
stated above, that the term “bill” in the statute includes
“cheque.” (2) That the payment by the plaintiff’s bankers
of the amount of the cheques drawn by the plaintiff to the
holders was in effect a payment by the plaintiff himself.
“He pays when his banker pays on his account.” A cheque
is a direction to pay so much money of the drawer, “actually
or assumedly in the possession of the drawee.” It would be
different if, in payment of a betting debt, the plaintiff had
drawn a bill of exchange which was subsequently paid by
the acceptor, as “it is not necessary nor usual that there
should be money of the drawers in the hands of the drawee
of a bill of exchange.” The language of this part of the
judgment would seem to leave it an open question, if the
drawer of the cheque had at the time no assets at the bank;
or in the case of a bill of exchange being given instead of a
cheque, if the acceptor recovered the amount from the drawer,
whether this would not amount to a “payment” by the
drawer within the section. (3) As to the set-off, the same
reasoning was applied. The amount of the cheque was not
paid by the defendant or his bankers, but by A’s bankers,
consequently it could not have been recovered in an action
by the defendant under this section, and could not be made
the subject of a set-off. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What instruments
are within the
statute.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As to the instruments that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>within the statute in the above case of <i>Hawker</i> v. <i>Hallewell</i><a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
the Vice-Chancellor seemed clearly of opinion that <i>bonds</i>
were within the equity of the statute. In the above case of
<i>Lynn</i> v. <i>Bell</i><a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a> it was held that “bills” in the statute included
“cheques.” In the judgment are to be found some
instructive observations as to the similarities and differences
between cheques and ordinary bills of exchange. In
<i>Parsons</i> v. <i>Alexander</i><a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> the plaintiff sued on a cheque and
also on an I O U, both given for a gaming debt; as the
cheque was unstamped the plaintiff relied on the I O U.
But as an I O U is not an instrument or security for a debt,
but only evidence of it, it was treated as void under 8 &#38; 9
Vict., c. 108, and not as illegal under 5 &#38; 6 William IV.,
c. 41. See, too, <i>Quarrier</i> v. <i>Coulston</i><a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>PART III.</i></h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</div>

<p class='c007'>Such was the state of the law at the commencement of the
present reign, until it was attempted to deal with wagers by
a broad and general enactment, which, however, left the
provisions of the Act of William IV. untouched.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Statute 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, s. 18 provides “that all
contracts or agreements, whether by parol or in writing, by
way of gaming or wagering shall be null and void, and no
suit shall be brought or maintained<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a> in any court of law or
equity to recover any sum of money or valuable thing
alleged to be won upon any wager or which should have
been deposited in the hands of any person to abide the
event on which any wager should have been made. Provided
that this enactment shall not be deemed to apply to
any subscription, contribution, or agreement to subscribe or
contribute for or towards any plate, prize, or sum of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to be awarded to the winner or winners of any lawful game,
sport or pastime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 15 of the Act repeals the Statute of Charles II.,
and so much of the Statute of Anne as was not altered by
5 &#38; 6 William IV., c. 41, and so much of 18 George II.,
c. 34, as related to the Statute of Anne or as rendered any
person liable to be indicted and punished for winning or
losing at any one time at play or by betting, the sum of
£10 or £20 within 24 hours.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General effect of statute.</div>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that this statute includes under one
sweeping enactment <i>all contracts by way of wagering</i>, and
therefore has a much wider application than the previous
Statutes of Charles II., Anne and William IV., which, as
has been before pointed out, apply only to wagers on games
and pastimes. Further, the statute introduces a change in
the attitude of the law towards transactions of this description
in that they are in no sense declared illegal; and all
the penal provisions of the earlier statutes are expressly
repealed. It merely makes them void and incapable of legal
enforcement, or, in the language of <span class='sc'>Lush, J.</span>, in the case of
<i>Haigh</i> v. <i>Town Council of Sheffield</i>,<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a> a wager is made “a
thing of a neutral character; not to be encouraged, but not
to be absolutely forbidden; it leaves an ordinary betting
debt a mere debt of honour, depriving it of legal obligation,
but not making it illegal.” The wording of the statute
seems moreover to be framed so as to cover the case which
arose in <i>Pugh</i> v. <i>Jenkins</i>,<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a> where the parties made a bet on
a race which had already been run, but the event was
unknown to either, and it was held that the earlier statutes
applied only to wagers before or at the time the gaming
was going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be convenient in the present place to consider
what is the precise operation of this statute on
contracts within 5 &#38; 6 William IV. That statute declared
that securities for the payment of bets on games and
pastimes (including horse-racing), as well as all contracts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>for the payment of the same, shall be deemed to be for
an illegal consideration; at any rate, that is the effect
given to the statute by <i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>? Combined
effect of 5 &#38; 6
Wm. IV. and
8 &#38; 9 Vict.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It might
well be questioned whether 8 &#38; 9 Vict. c. 109, s. 18,
leaves that statute unaffected (in which case all such contracts
would still be illegal), or whether the wording of
the Act is not sufficiently wide to embrace such contracts
and make them merely void like other wagers, that is, in the
language of Sir <span class='sc'>Montague Smith</span> in <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Hill</i>,<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a> to
“abolish the distinction between legal and illegal wagers.”
Of course the latter construction leaves the seeming anomaly
of a contract being merely void when standing by itself, but
illegal when forming the consideration for a bill of exchange
or other security. It is, however, submitted that this is the
true view of the matter. There is good reason for declaring
such a consideration for a bill of exchange illegal, because
there are certain well-known rules of law relating to bills of
exchange given for illegal consideration, rules based on
convenience, and designed for the protection of innocent
holders; and it was, no doubt, thought advisable to put
bills given for betting debts on the same footing. It is a
strong argument in favour of this view that in nearly all the
cases of actions in respect of betting transactions (where the
bet was on a horse-race or other game) it seems to have been
almost assumed that such gaming is only void under 8 &#38; 9
Vict., c. 109: at the same time with the single exception of
<i><span lang="la">ex parte Pyke</span></i><a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a> the point does not seem to have been raised;
but in that case it was argued that the effect of the Statute
5 &#38; 6 William IV. was, as interpreted by <i>Applegarth</i> v.
<i>Colley</i>,<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a> to make bets on games, &#38;c., illegal. The point,
however, was not decided, as the Court held that the facts
did not bring the case within the statute. There is at
any rate no question that wager-contracts are avoided
only, and not rendered illegal by virtue of 8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wagers void,
not illegal by
8 &#38; 9 Vict.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is not necessary to refer to every case which
recognises that fact. The following are perhaps the cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>which best illustrate the difference in the effects of
illegal and void contracts.—<i>Inchbald</i> v. <i>Cotterill</i>,<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c015'><sup>[91]</sup></a> where a
broker sued for work and labour done and money paid at
defendant’s request, in and about the purchases and sales of
shares in a Railway Company. <i>Held</i>, that even supposing
the “money paid” could not be recovered, there was no
answer to the count for work done: and as there was
nothing illegal about paying money on gaming transactions
(as there was under Barnard’s Act), the rest of the consideration
was not tainted. In <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i><a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a> and <i>Read</i>
v. <i>Anderson</i>,<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a> the agent was assumed entitled to indemnity
from his principal in respect of gaming transactions entered
into on his behalf, which he clearly would not be entitled to
recover in respect of illegal contracts. So in <i>Fitch</i> v.
<i>Jones</i>,<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a> where a bill was given for a betting debt not
illegal within 5 &#38; 6 William IV., it was held that a
merely void consideration did not throw the onus on to the
indorsee’s shoulders of proving that he was a <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i>
holder for value.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indian Law.</div>

<p class='c007'>It may be advisable here to notice that the Indian
Contract Act contains provisions of a very similar
character. By Art. 30, “all agreements by way of wager
are void; and no suit shall be brought to recover anything
alleged to be won on any wager or entrusted to any
person to abide the result of any game or other uncertain
event.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This section shall not be deemed to render unlawful a
subscription or contribution or agreement for any subscription
or contribution for any plate, prize, or sums of money
of the value of 500 rupees or upwards, to be awarded to
the winner of any horse-race.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that nearly all the cases decided on the English
Statute will apply to these provisions of the Indian Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The questions which have arisen as to the construction
and effect of the Statute 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, s. 18, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>perhaps be grouped under the three following main
headings.</p>

<p class='c017'>I.—What are contracts by way of gaming within
the statute.</p>

<p class='c017'>II.—The effect of the declaration that “no action
shall be brought,” &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c017'>III.—The proviso in favour of a subscription or
contribution to a prize.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>I.—Contracts by way of gaming.</div>

<p class='c007'>I.—Under this heading the following topics are of
importance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Consensus ad idem.</i></div>

<p class='c007'>(1) There must be a <i><span lang="la">consensus ad idem</span></i> by both sides to
the agreement, and that <i><span lang="la">consensus</span></i> must relate to an
agreement, which of itself constitutes a wager. It is not
sufficient that one of the parties should have it in his mind
to speculate or gamble, terms which are used metaphorically
and are inclined to be misleading: it is essential that the
other party should be privy to and assist in the intent to
wager. It is of great importance to bear this in mind in
dealings on the Stock Exchange, where a purchaser may
simply buy for the purpose of selling again, receiving the
difference in price in case of a rise. The vendor is probably
entirely ignorant of the purchaser’s ultimate intentions. If
this is so the contract cannot be in the nature of a wager,
as is dearly laid down in <i>Marten</i> v. <i>Gibbons</i><a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> and <i>Thacker</i> v.
<i>Hardy</i>.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c015'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>One must win, the other must lose.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) It is essential to a wager-contract that “one party
should win and another should lose upon a future uncertain
event.... Some transactions, however, on which the
parties may win or lose upon a future uncertain event, are
not within 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109; for instance, the sale of next
year’s apple crop, in which the parties may be losers or
winners, but the essential element of a wager-contract is
wanting.”<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that the Lord Justice did not mean this to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>be an exhaustive definition of a wager, as it seems to omit
one important requisite, viz., mutuality. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mutuality
necessary.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If a man promises
to give his wife a new ball dress if the gold mine pays a 10
per cent. dividend for the current half-year, this would
scarcely be a wager, as the wife would not stand to lose anything.
That this is the ordinary understanding on the subject
is clear from the fact that by the “Rules of Betting”
it is no bet unless there is a possibility for each to lose as
well as to win. Under the old law, when wagers were
enforceable, one party could not have sued the other unless
the other would have been able to sue him. In <i>Blaxton</i> v.
<i>Pye</i><a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a> the plaintiff laid odds of 14 to 8 against a horse to
the defendant. By the then law no greater sum than £10
could be recovered on a wager, so that the defendant could
not have sued the plaintiff if the horse had won. The horse
lost, but <i>held</i> that the plaintiff could not recover the £8 on
the ground of want of mutuality.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c015'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) It is, however, clear that not every contract which
contains the element of mutual promises to pay is a
wager. A builder agrees with an owner of land to build a
house by a certain date, he to be paid £1,000 on completion;
in default, he to pay £100 by way of penalty. This would
not seem to be a wager. On the other hand, if A promises
to pay B £100 if the house be finished by the time fixed,
and B promises to pay £100 if it is not, both A and B being
independent of the building contract, this would appear to
be a wager. It is submitted that the true test is that in a
wager the sole elements of the contract must be made up of
the reciprocal promises to pay on the happening of given
alternative contingencies.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c015'><sup>[100]</sup></a> A promises to pay B on the
happening of contingency <i>x</i>, B promises to pay A on the
happening of contingency <i>y</i>; <i>y</i>, of course, may be negative,
such as the non-happening of <i>x</i>. The difference between
the two is illustrated by an ordinary bet on a horse race.
A backs a horse with B; B is popularly said to “lay against”
the horse, <i>i.e.</i>, to back the negative contingency of the horse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>not winning. As a matter of fact, “the layer” backs “the
field.”<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c015'><sup>[101]</sup></a> Each event or contingency must, of course, be uncertain,
or, at all events, unknown to the parties, that is, it
represents a chance, and where the chances are agreed to be
uneven the inequality is represented by odds. It must not,
however, be supposed that a wager necessarily embodies the
backing of conflicting opinions; the parties back their respective
chances or contingencies, not their opinions on
them, <i>e.g.</i>, a man backs a horse for a race at a long price:
if the horse goes to a much shorter price, he will very likely
hedge by backing the field against him, though feeling
certain that he will win. (See Appendix C.)</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary that the event should be independent
of the control of the parties, <i>e.g.</i>, two persons agree to run a
match for £5 a side.</p>

<p class='c007'>This criticism certainly seems to suggest the distinction
between the two cases above given of agreements with
respect to the completion of the building. The first case
contains more than mutual promises to pay on contingencies—it
is a contract of personal service, an agreement to do
something at the request of another. The second case
contains no such element; <i>the sole factors of the contract
are the mutual promises to pay each other on the happening
of their respective events</i>. It is easy to apply this test to
such ordinary wagers as bets on horse races, and to the
less common cases of wagers on the rise or fall of stocks on
difference bargains. (See more fully as to this the chapters
on Stock Exchange Transactions.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Substance rather than form of contract important.</div>

<p class='c007'>(4.) In conjunction with the last proposition a rule may,
perhaps, be stated as follows, that it is not the form, but
the substance of the contract that is important. Thus, in
<i>Hill</i> v. <i>Fox</i><a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c015'><sup>[102]</sup></a> the loser of several bets borrowed £2,000 from
one of his creditors, and paid him the bets out of the
money. The lender sued to recover the money lent. The
Court held that if at the time of the advance there was an
“agreement or stipulation” that the bets should be repaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>out of the £2,000, then the transaction was merely a colourable
evasion for obtaining a security for a betting debt;
but that if the borrower were at liberty to do as he pleased
with the money, even though the lender hoped that he
would be repaid out of the money, then it would be a <i><span lang="la">bonâ
fide</span></i> loan, which could be recovered. So in <i>Rourke</i> v. <i>Short</i>,<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c015'><sup>[103]</sup></a>
the plaintiff was about to sell some rags to the defendant,
when a dispute arose about the price of a former lot of rags,
the plaintiff asserting them to have been of one price, and
the defendant said they were sold for more. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wagers under
guise of sales.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They agreed
to refer the dispute to M, a wine and spirit merchant, and
that whichever party was wrong should pay M for a gallon
of brandy, and that if the plaintiff was right the price of
the present lot should be 6s. per cwt., but if the defendant
was right the price was to be 3s. M decided that the
plaintiff was right. Plaintiff tendered the rags to the
defendant, but he refused to accept them at 6s., but offered
5s. The plaintiff sued to recover the higher price, and defendant
pleaded that it was a wager within the statute. The
Court held that the plea was good, as the contract was, both
in form and substance, nothing but a wager; it was not like
a case of determining the price by the mere ascertainment of
the former price. It was not the value of the goods that
was to be determined, but the correctness of the parties’
opinions. In the course of argument, <i>Grizewood</i> v. <i>Blaine</i><a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c015'><sup>[104]</sup></a>
was quoted. In that case it was held that a contract
nominally for the sale of shares, but in reality an agreement
for the payment of differences was a wager. But in the
present case <span class='sc'>Lord Campbell</span> observed that the contract was
in form a wager, and that it lay on the plaintiff to show that
it was in substance something else.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this case should be compared <i>Crofton</i> v. <i>Colgan</i>.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c015'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
There the agreement was that the defendant should take the
plaintiff’s mare in exchange for his own; and that defendant
should give plaintiff half the winnings of her first two
races, or in case she should be sold before then, defendant
should pay plaintiff one-third of what she should be sold for.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><i>Held</i> that this was not a wager, but only a means of assessing
the price of the mare in certain events.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sale with contingencies.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not difficult to apply the decision in this case to a
transaction which is by no means uncommon in respect of
a race horse, viz.: a sale with contingencies, <i>i.e.</i>, where the
purchaser agrees to pay the seller a share of whatever the
horse may win in any one or more engagements. Such a
contract is in no way a wager.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Brogden</i> v. <i>Marriott</i>, 3 Bing., N.C.</div>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, in <i>Brogden</i> v. <i>Marriott</i>,<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c015'><sup>[106]</sup></a> the agreement
was for the purchase of a horse for £200, if he trotted 18
miles within a hour, and for a shilling if he failed. The
Court held that this was simply a wager on a trotting match
against time, and so void under the Statute of Anne.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Agreement with a tipster for a share of winnings.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Higginson</i> v. <i>Simpson</i><a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c015'><sup>[107]</sup></a> the plaintiff was what is known
as a “tipster,” or a person who supplied other persons with
information as to likely winners of races, and had supplied
defendant with the name of a horse called Regal for the
Grand National, and it was agreed between them that the
plaintiff should have £2 on Regal, at 25 to 1 against that
horse for that race, <i>i.e.</i>, that if the defendant backed Regal
and the horse won the plaintiff was to have £50, but if it
lost plaintiff was to pay defendant £2. Defendant backed
Regal, and it won; and plaintiff sued to recover £50. The
Court held that it was necessary to look not only at the
form of the contract, but also at the substance; that even
if one element in the contract was the remuneration of the
plaintiff for his personal skill, yet “the ultimate effect of
the bargain was to be wholly dependent upon the occurring
of an event over which neither party had any control.” But
see Appendix A, where some observations on this case are
suggested.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stakes deposited on horse-races, games, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c007'>(4.) There appears to be no difference between competing
in horse-races or games for stakes deposited by the competitors,
and betting on the competitors; both are equally
agreements by way of wagering. Thus until the passing of
the Statute 3 &#38; 4 Vict., c. 35, horse-racing was subject to
certain penal restrictions. Even after it had been legalised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>generally by that statute, it was held in <i>Bentinck</i> v. <i>Connop</i><a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c015'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
that the only effect of the statute was to exempt it from the
penal provisions of earlier statutes; it did not make wagers
on horse-races recoverable: consequently where two or more
persons agreed upon a horse-race for certain stakes (not
deposited), it was held that such an agreement was a wager
and nothing more; so that the winner could not recover the
stakes from the loser. So in the more modern case of <i>Diggle</i>
v. <i>Higgs</i><a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c015'><sup>[109]</sup></a> the Court construed an agreement between two
persons for a walking match for £200 a side as a wager.
We shall have occasion to revert to this case again when
we come to treat of the difference between a wager and a
contribution to a prize.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Distinction between “stakes” and “sum added.”</div>

<p class='c007'>An important distinction was drawn in the case of <i>Applegarth</i>
v. <i>Colley</i>,<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c015'><sup>[110]</sup></a> between stakes contributed by the competitors
(which were then irrecoverable under certain circumstances)
and a “sum added” by a third party as part of the
prize to the winner. The latter it was held could be recovered
by the winner. A race for a prize given by a third party
seems to lack one of the elements of a wager suggested above,
viz., that “one must win and the other must lose;” for
while one party might be said to win the prize, the other
cannot be said to lose it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If then, as it is submitted, an agreement for an ordinary
horse-race for stakes deposited or subscribed by the competitors
themselves is in strict law a mere wager, it must be
borne in mind that the law as to depositors and stakeholders,
the determination of the authority of the latter, &#38;c., is applicable
to such cases. A full account of the cases on this
subject is given <i>post</i> p. 60 <i><span lang="la">et seq.</span></i></p>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered moreover that since the passing
of 8 &#38; 9 Vict. c. 109, s. 11, which avoids “all contracts by
way of wagering,” the distinctions drawn in <i>Applegarth</i> v.
<i>Colley</i> with regard to prepayment and the amount of the
stakes will only hold good so far as it affects a cheque given
in payment of the stakes. This has been explained above,
Cap. I., Pt. 2.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Void nominations—could executors pay stakes?</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>This view of the law has an important bearing on a question
which was a great deal discussed not long ago as to the
propriety of the rule (Rule 86 of the Rules of Racing)
which provides that all entries become void on the death of
the nominator or person in whose name the entry is made.
It has been urged that executors ought to have the option of
paying the stakes and so adopting the horse’s engagements
(see the leading article in <cite>The Sporting Life</cite>, December 21,
1885). But even if the rule were altered to allow of this,
it seems impossible to escape from the decision just referred
to—that the payment of stakes in respect of a horse-race
is nothing less than the payment of a wager between the
competitors. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Or forfeits.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The difficulty would occur in the payment
of “Forfeits,” which seem to be in the nature of a penalty
for not keeping a horse in his engagements. As we shall
point out hereafter a penalty payable on making default in
a wager cannot legally be recovered, <i>post</i> p. 63. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Executors
cannot pay
betting debts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is perfectly
clear that an executor must not pay the gaming debts
of his testator. See <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Purcell</i>.<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c015'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When we come to the law as to stakeholders, we have
occasion to make one or two suggestions as to the rights or
duties of executors where their testator has actually paid in
respect of entries, stakes, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the rule were altered as suggested, it would be wise
for turfites to give their executors full powers in their wills.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rescission by wager.</div>

<p class='c007'>(5.) Sometimes a valid contract is attempted to be rescinded
by a wager, <i>e.g.</i>, if A is indebted to B in a certain sum,
and they agree to toss for “double or quits.” It seems
clear that this being simply a wager would not be valid,
and that A’s original liability would remain.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Wilson</i> v. <i>Coleman</i><a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c015'><sup>[112]</sup></a> plaintiff had contracted to take a
lease of defendant’s house, having paid a deposit of £25.
Defendant offered plaintiff £50 to rescind the agreement,
which plaintiff refused. The parties then tossed whether
the contract should be rescinded for £50 or £75. The
defendant won, and plaintiff sued to recover £50. The Court
interpreted the agreement as an absolute rescission for £50
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>with £25 more if plaintiff won the toss. The two bargains
were therefore separate, and the first part of the agreement
was not vitiated by the second part being a wager. Otherwise
the whole rescission would have been void.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Speculative sales or purchases.</div>

<p class='c007'>(6.) Speculative sales, that is, of goods or merchandise not
in the possession of the vendor at the time of the contract,
are neither illegal at Common Law, nor are they wagers
within the statute. But in the early part of this century a
doctrine was propounded that they were illegal. Thus, in
<i>Bryan</i> v. <i>Lewis</i><a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c015'><sup>[113]</sup></a> the plaintiff sued a broker for negligence in
carrying out instructions for the sale of nutmegs. It
appeared that the plaintiff was not the owner of the nutmegs
at the time, but intended to go into the market and buy.
<span class='sc'>Abbott, C. J.</span>, who had previously, in <i>Lorymer</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c015'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
said that such contracts were not to be encouraged, now laid
it down that no action could be maintained on a contract to
sell goods which he has not in possession at the time, but
which he simply intends to go and purchase in the market,
adding that “the law was not new.” The ground of this
opinion seems to have been, that such contracts amounted to
a wager on the price, and had a tendency to make prices
unsteady; at any rate, this was the line of argument adopted
in <i>Hibblethwaite</i> v. <i>M’Morine</i>,<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c015'><sup>[115]</sup></a> in 1839, when the same point
came before the Court of Exchequer; but the Court unanimously
overruled <i>Bryan</i> v. <i>Lewis</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Engrossing.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There was an offence at
Common Law, known as “Engrossing,” which meant buying
up large quantities of goods with intent to sell them again,
which seems to hinge upon the same principle as the speculative
sales denounced by <span class='sc'>Abbott, C. J.</span> But the law in this
respect, which had long been a dead letter, was repealed by
a statute, 7 &#38; 8 Vict., c. 24.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides, as was said in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>,<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c015'><sup>[116]</sup></a> and <i>Martin</i> v.
<i>Gibbons</i>,<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c015'><sup>[117]</sup></a> neither the sale of next year’s apple crop nor of
the next haul of a fisherman’s net were wagers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The selling of public stocks, not in the possession of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>vendor, was made an offence by <span class='sc'>Barnard’s</span> Act, but this
was repealed by 23 &#38; 24 Vict., c. 28. It was decided by
<span class='sc'>Lindley, J.</span>, in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i><a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c015'><sup>[118]</sup></a> that there was nothing
contrary to public policy, as was contended, in making large
purchases on the Stock Exchange by way of speculation, <i>i.e.</i>,
for the purpose of reselling at an advanced price. It is
fortunate that already too elastic phrase “contrary to public
policy” was not allowed to stretch to so unreasonable a
length, as it is difficult precisely to estimate what the
result would have been to the business world if such a
contention had prevailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law as now settled in England has been incorporated
into the Indian Contract Act, Art. 88 of which provides
that “a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered at a
future day is binding though the goods are not in the possession
of the vendor at the time of the contract, and though he
has not at the time any expectation of acquiring them otherwise
than by purchase.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Contracts between principal and agent not wagers.</div>

<p class='c007'>(7.) Questions frequently occur as to the rights as between
principal and agent when the latter has been employed by
the former to make a wager for him. We have then to
consider—</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>a.</i>) The rights of the principal against the agent.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>b.</i>) The rights of the agent against the principal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general result appears to be, that the contract between
the principal and the agent, by which the latter undertakes to
carry out wagering transactions on behalf of the former, does
not itself partake of the nature of a wager.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rights of principal against agent.</div>

<p class='c007'>(<i>a.</i>) It seems that if an agent employed to bet for a principal
receive money in respect of winnings he is liable to
account to his principal for it. The obligation of the agent
arises not by virtue of a contract by way of wagering, but
out of an implied contract to pay over money received to
his principal’s use; it is in fact a new and independent contract.
There is, it is true, a decision of <span class='sc'>Stuart, V.C.</span>, to a
contrary effect. In <i>Beyer</i> v. <i>Adams</i><a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c015'><sup>[119]</sup></a> the loser of a bet paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the money into the hands of the plaintiff’s betting agent, who
had negotiated the bet for him. The agent died and the
plaintiff sought to prove against his estate in respect of the
sum the agent had received. His honour held that the claim
could not be sustained. “The language of the statute was
perfectly general as to the persons against whom an action
was not to lie; and did not solely apply to actions against
the loser of a wager. The cases quoted in support of the
claim only decided that the receipt of money by the agent
was a good consideration for a bill of exchange, as in <i>Johnson</i>
v. <i>Lansley</i>. Those cases like <i>Tenant</i> v. <i>Elliott</i> which
showed that an agent could not set up illegality against his
principal only dealt with general principles, and not with
the words of an express Act of Parliament.” It is no doubt
a perfectly true distinction between that case and the earlier
ones, and that the latter turned on the question of sufficiency
of consideration for a bill of exchange, and the same was
the case in <i>Beeston</i> v. <i>Beeston</i>, where <span class='sc'>Amphlett, B.</span>,
expressly reserves the question “Whether the defendant
could keep the money in his pocket if he won?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Partners.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Lansley</i><a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c015'><sup>[120]</sup></a> the plaintiff and A were partners
in betting transactions. A received the whole of the
winnings, and endorsed to the plaintiff a bill accepted by
the defendant in payment of plaintiff’s share. Defendant
pleaded that the statute deprived the plaintiff of his remedy,
but <i>held</i> that the consideration for the endorsement was
money for which A was bound to account to plaintiff, and
the statue did not relieve him from that liability.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Savage</i> v. <i>Madden</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>Again, in <i>Savage</i> v. <i>Madden</i><a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c015'><sup>[121]</sup></a>, where plaintiff sued defendant
for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff,
defendant pleaded that the money was due to plaintiff on
wagers upon a horse-race. Baron <span class='sc'>Martin</span> said: “If I were
called upon to give a judgment on this plea, I should be
disposed to say it was bad, as it does not allege that the
money was won by the plaintiff <i>from the defendant himself</i>.
I think the common form of an account stated would be all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>satisfied by the money claimed by the plaintiff having come
into the hands of the defendant, a third person for the purpose
of his paying it over to the plaintiff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite clear that his lordship considers the obligation
of an agent who has received money won on a wager on
behalf of his principal, to pay over what he has received is
in no way a wagering transaction in itself, though it may
arise out of such. This seems in accordance with the
view of Baron <span class='sc'>Pollock</span> in <i>Beeston</i> v. <i>Beeston</i><a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c015'><sup>[122]</sup></a>, that the
statutes only apply to contracts as between the parties to the
wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the matter has lately been confirmed by the
Court of Appeal in <i>Bridger</i> v. <i>Savage</i><a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c015'><sup>[123]</sup></a>, so that <i>Beyer</i> v.
<i>Adams</i> must be considered as overruled. Seeing, however,
that in these cases the transactions were not illegal, they
must not be considered as deciding a somewhat vexed
question whether a principal agent or a partner can recover,
and where the transactions are illegal, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Qy. if transaction
illegal.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
as for instance, under
the Gaming House or Betting House Acts, we shall deal
with this subject in the chapter on such establishments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Actions of this description, that is, by principals against
their agents for money received, have of late been numerous,
as well as by agents against their principals to recover
commission and reimbursements; but of this latter class of
action we speak later on. Experience seems to show that
the advantage is on the side of the agent, seeing that the
plaintiff has to prove facts which are generally solely within
the agent’s knowledge. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>What principal
must
prove.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(1) The agreement between himself
and the agent. Where this agreement is in writing, as
where the parties have contracted on the footing of written
conditions, the difficulty should not be great; but frequently
the instructions are given verbally. (2) That the agent made
the bet in his, the plaintiff’s, behalf. If he did not, of course
no action could lie for money had and received.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cohen</i> v.
<i>Kittle</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the case
of <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>Kittle</i><a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c015'><sup>[124]</sup></a> this difficulty was felt; consequently an
alternative claim was inserted in the pleadings for damages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>for breach of contract in neglecting to make the bet. The
case was ultimately fought in the question whether such an
action was maintainable. The Court held chiefly on the
authority of <i>Webster</i> v. <i>De Tastet</i><a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c015'><sup>[125]</sup></a> that no such action would
lie, seeing that even if the agent had made such a bet the
plaintiff could not have enforced it legally against any third
party.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, submitted with great deference that this
decision is incorrect. It appears to confuse two distinct
questions: (<i>a</i>) whether the action would lie; (<i>b</i>) proof of
damage sustained. Betting contracts not being illegal there
would seem to be no reason why the breach of an agreement
to make a bet should not be a cause of action. <i>Webster</i> v.
<i>De Tastet</i> was an action to recover commission on a policy
contrary to the policy of the law. It, moreover, did not
appear that there was any conventional forum by which such
a policy could have been enforced. In most betting transactions
the agent belongs to a club, the committee of which
would enforce any bet that was made against a defaulter by
the penalty of expulsion.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c015'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Gaming Amendment Act.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is noticeable that Lord Herschel’s Act, the Gaming
Act Amendment Act, of which further mention will
be made hereafter, while preventing an agent from
recovering commission or reimbursement from his principal,
does not contain a reciprocal restriction on the
principal’s right to recover winnings from his agent; consequently
the principal’s rights against his agent, as established
by the cases above quoted, remain untouched. Seeing,
however, that, by Lord Herschel’s Act, the agent cannot
recover his commission in respect of his services, he would
seem now to be in the position of a gratuitous agent, in
which case no action would lie against him at the suit of his
principal for neglecting to carry out his instructions unless,
<i>semble</i>, he receives his commission in advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The plaintiff also has to show that the agent received
the money in respect of his bet. This proposition scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>requires authority. See, however, the dictum of Hawkins, J.,
in <i>Cowan</i> v. <i>O’Connor</i>;<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c015'><sup>[127]</sup></a> but it is sometimes a difficulty in the
plaintiff’s way. No doubt it is not necessary to show that
actual cash passed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Payment by
set off.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the agent settled with the bookmakers
by balancing accounts with him, this would no doubt
be equivalent to payment.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c015'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Estoppel of agent.</div>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Moore</i> v. <i>Peachey</i><a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c015'><sup>[129]</sup></a> will no doubt go some way
to remove the plaintiff’s difficulty in this respect. <span class='sc'>Charles, J.</span>,
held that the defendant having entered into an agency
agreement, and from time to time rendered accounts to the
plaintiff, showing bets to have been made and moneys
received or paid on his behalf, was estopped from denying
the truth of his representations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must, however, be admitted, for it is common knowledge,
that the documents passing between the supposed principal
and agent do not represent the real facts. In a majority of
such cases the agent is a myth; he is in reality a bookmaker
making a book with his different clients, that is if his
<i><span lang="fr">clientèle</span></i> is sufficiently large. If not, a common course of
business (and this has frequently been proved in the Courts)
is for him to lay his clients the odds at a point or two below
the market odds, and “back the horse back” in a club at
the longer odds. Of course, if this be professedly his
business, he is amenable to the provisions of the Betting
House Act (as to which see <i>post</i>). That is no doubt the
reason why he affects to act as agent; but <i>Moore</i> v. <i>Peachey</i>
(<i><span lang="la">ubi sup.</span></i>) says that he cannot afterwards turn round and say
he was a principal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rights of agent against principal.</div>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b.</i>) The next class of cases in which the application of
the statute has come in question is where an agent has
been employed to enter into wager-contracts on behalf of a
principal; the bets are lost; the agent pays, and seeks to
recover from the principal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this matter two distinct questions have arisen.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. Whether an authority to bet implies an authority to
pay the bet if lost.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>II. Granted such implied authority, can the principal
revoke the authority to pay, after the event has been
determined, and before payment has been made?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Does authority to bet imply authority to pay?</div>

<p class='c007'>I. Upon this question none of the older authorities go
very close to the mark. Thus in <i>Oulds</i> v. <i>Harrison</i><a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c015'><sup>[130]</sup></a> the
defendant employed one Bennett to bet for him, and Bennett
laid the bets in his own name on the defendant’s account.
The bets were lost, and Bennett, without further authority
from defendant, paid them, and drew a bill on defendant for
the amounts, which was accepted by the defendant, and
indorsed by Bennett to the plaintiff. Plaintiff sued defendant
on the bill. For the defendant it was argued that the payment
of the debts by Bennett was in his own wrong and not
authorised by his agency. But the Court held that defendant
by accepting the bill acknowledged that the payments had
been made on his account, and that consequently there was
a sufficient consideration for the bill. It must be observed
that this case did not decide the point, viz., whether an
authority to bet included an authority to pay the bets if lost;
from a remark of <span class='sc'>Parke’s, B.</span> (at page 577), “the defendant
was not bound in law to repay the drawer,” it would seem
that in his view it did not. <i>Jessop</i> v. <i>Lutwyche</i><a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c015'><sup>[131]</sup></a> turned on
a pleading point: the plaintiff, a broker, sued to recover
differences paid by him on the sale of certain stocks and
shares on behalf of the plaintiff. Defendant simply pleaded
the Statute 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, and it was held that the plea
was bad, as being consistent with the plaintiff’s having paid
the money at defendant’s <i>express</i> request. The plea in
<i>Knight</i> v. <i>Chambers</i><a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c015'><sup>[132]</sup></a> was overruled on the same grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Rosewarne</i> v. <i>Billing</i><a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c015'><sup>[133]</sup></a> carried the point no
further. This was another action by a broker to recover
differences paid for his principal. The defendant pleaded
the statute without traversing the averment that the money
was paid at defendant’s request. The Court, following the
former cases, held the plea bad; but <span class='sc'>Erle, C. J.</span>, in giving
judgment, expressed his opinion that an authority to bet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>implied an authority to pay if the bets are lost; and <i>semble</i>
that if a broker be compellable by the usage of the stock
market to pay losses himself, the principal could not rescind
the authority to pay. The older case of <i>Clayton</i> v. <i>Dilley</i><a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c015'><sup>[134]</sup></a>
was decided in the Statute of Anne. The plaintiff, the
defendant’s betting agent, sought to recover money he had
paid for the defendant without express authority to do so.
The bets were admittedly illegal by statute. It was held
that plaintiff could not recover on the ground that there
being no express direction to pay, it could not be implied in
an illegal transaction. This case would therefore seem to
have little importance at the present day, betting transactions
being void and not illegal. The case of <i><span lang="la">ex parte Godfrey</span></i><a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c015'><sup>[135]</sup></a>
seems to be the earliest direct decision on the point, where it
was held by <span class='sc'>Bacon, V.C.</span>, that money paid by a broker on
so-called gaming transactions entered into by him for a
principal, was a debt for which a bankruptcy petition might
be presented, as the principal knew that the broker was liable
under the rules of the Stock Exchange to pay losses, a request
to pay on behalf of the principal must be implied. From this
decision it would seem that this authority to pay would not
be implied unless the principal knew of the liability which
the agent was incurring. In <i>Bubb</i> v. <i>Yelverton</i><a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c015'><sup>[136]</sup></a> (which is
reported very shortly) Lord <span class='sc'>Romilly</span> laid down in general
terms that an authority to bet implied authority to pay; but
in that case (in which Lord Charles Ker claimed payment
out of the Marquis of Hastings’ estate for money paid on lost
bets, he having been the Marquis’ agent to bet for him) there
could have been no question as to knowledge on the part of
the Marquis of the consequences that would result from the
agent’s not paying.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i><a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c015'><sup>[137]</sup></a> does not afford much
assistance on the present point as to the authority to pay
being implied from authority to bet, as according to the
view taken of the facts by <span class='sc'>Lindley, L.J.</span>, which view was
supported by the Court of Appeal, the transaction does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>seem to have been in the nature of a wager. The case,
however, being an action by an agent for indemnity against
his principal, the knowledge of the latter as to the course of
business the agent would have to pursue, is made one of the
grounds of his liability to his agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Oldham</i> v. <i>Ramsbotham</i><a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c015'><sup>[138]</sup></a> the question was slightly
touched upon in argument, but not noticed in the judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Godwin</i><a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c015'><sup>[139]</sup></a> plaintiff at defendant’s instructions
and in his presence laid £40 on a horse called Vril for the
Ascot Stakes. The horse lost and plaintiff paid the bet.
The Court of Appeal held that he could recover the money
he had paid from the defendant. Per <span class='sc'>Jessel, M.R.</span>, “If
you employ an agent to bet for you, <i>you know</i> that he must
pay or be subject to unpleasant consequences. <i>If you do not
withdraw your request</i>, it must continue; and if he pays, he
pays at your request.” <span class='sc'>Lindley, L.J.</span>, also added a more
general proposition that an authority to pay was implied in
an authority to bet. It is clear that the agent in this case
laid the bet in his own name.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these remarks of the <span class='sc'>Master of the Rolls</span> it
would seem (1) That the implied authority of the agent
to pay depends on the knowledge of the principal that
the agent was himself liable legally or otherwise, which
knowledge would probably be presumed in cases of betting
through regular betting agents, as in both such cases it is
well known that the agent is bound by usage to incur
personal responsibility. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Is authority
to pay
revocable?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(2) That the principal might
withdraw this implied authority to pay any time before the
agent had paid the money over to the winner, and so
prevent the agent’s paying on his account.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The general rule of law is that where an agent is invested
with an authority coupled with an interest, that is,
where the authority is given to the donee of such authority
for a good consideration for the purpose of securing to him
some benefit, such authority is irrevocable.<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c015'><sup>[140]</sup></a> Now it has of
late been a much vexed question whether the express or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>implied authority of a betting agent to pay a bet if lost,
where the agent has made the bet in his own name, can be
revoked by the principal, or, in other words, whether such
authority is so coupled with an interest as to be irrevocable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long ago the very point came before the Courts, in
<i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>,<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c015'><sup>[141]</sup></a> and this was the first occasion on which
it underwent serious discussion. There were a few dicta on
the subject—that by <span class='sc'>Earle, C.J.</span>, in <i>Rosewarne</i> v. <i>Billing</i>,<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c015'><sup>[142]</sup></a>
and again the point was mooted in <i>Marten</i> v. <i>Gibbons</i>.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c015'><sup>[143]</sup></a> In
this case the defendant had, through the plaintiff, a stock
broker, sold a future dividend on railway stock to a firm of
jobbers. The dividend was eventually declared at a higher
rate than that at which the defendant had sold it. Defendant
being called upon to pay the difference refused, and revoked
the authority of the plaintiff to pay. Plaintiff paid and
sued to recover from defendant. Sales of future dividends
were not enforceable by the rules of the Stock Exchange.
Defendant contended that the authority of the plaintiff to
pay had been revoked, but <span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span>, in giving judgment
said: “If the contract was binding on the plaintiff it
was impossible for the defendant to revoke it. If not enforceable
and not revoked they would be liable. If not enforceable
and revoked, I am inclined to agree that they would
still be liable.” But in this case the plaintiffs had, as brokers,
entered into a contract which, although not enforceable
against them by expulsion according to the rules of the
Stock Exchange, left them, in the opinion of the Court,
under a legal liability to the jobbers. In a wagering
transaction the case is different, as the agent is under no
legal liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other side the dictum of the <span class='sc'>Master of the Rolls</span>
in <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Godwin</i> seems to imply that the authority in a
betting transaction can be revoked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i><a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c015'><sup>[144]</sup></a> the following were the material
facts of the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff was a turf commission agent, and a member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of Tattersall’s subscription rooms. The defendant had been
in the habit of employing plaintiff to bet for him, paying
losses to him and receiving winnings from him. By a well-established
usage <i>known to defendant</i>, such commission
agent employed to back horses does so in his own name,
and becomes responsible for payment if the bet is lost to
him. The defendant by telegram instructed the plaintiff
to back certain horses for him, which plaintiff did in his
own name. The race was fixed for 2 o’clock, and at 3.5
plaintiff handed in at the office a telegram announcing that
the horses had lost. Defendant the same evening repudiated
the bets, and all liability under them, on the
ground that the plaintiff ought to have informed him that
he was “on” before the race was run. On the settling day
plaintiff paid the bets in question to the winners; had he
not done so he would have been liable as a defaulter under
Rule 3 of Tattersall’s subscription room to be excluded from
it, and also under Rule 50 of the Jockey Club would, on
being reported by such committee as a defaulter, have been
subject to various disqualifications under Rule 49 of the
rules of racing as to entering and running horses. It does
not appear from the report of the case that the defendant
knew of the specific consequences that would ensue from the
plaintiff’s making default in payment of the bets. On
behalf of the defendant it was contended (1) That the
plaintiff’s authority to bet was subject to an express condition
that plaintiff should before the race inform defendant
that he was “on.” (2) That anyhow such condition was
implied by universal usage. (3) That the bets were wagering contracts
that the plaintiff had no authority to pay them, or
that if he had such authority was revoked. The judgment
of <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, proceeded on the following grounds: (1)
He found as a fact that there was no such condition, either
express or implied, as that contended for by defendant; also
that the bets had <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> been made in accordance with
the authority. (2) That wagering contracts being only
void, and not illegal by 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, the loser of the
bet might lawfully either pay himself, or request somebody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>else to pay for him. (3) That such request might be
express or implied, and he found <i>as a fact</i> that defendant,
in giving authority to make the bets, also gave authority to
pay them if lost. (4) Found, <i>as a fact</i>, that defendant had
not revoked this implied authority to pay. (5) Irrespective
of the latter finding such authority was irrecoverable as
being an authority which plaintiff had an interest in carrying
out; as otherwise he would have incurred serious penalties
as a defaulter. (6) That the plaintiff’s case might also be
put on the following ground: That if one man employs
another to do a legal act, which, in the ordinary course of
things will involve the agent in obligations pecuniary or
otherwise, a contract on the part of the employer to indemnify
his agent is implied by law&#160;... and it
signifies nothing that such obligation is not enforceable in a
Court of Justice. (7) His lordship distinctly reserved the
question as to how far these incidents would apply where the
agent bets, not in his own name, but in that of his principal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indemnity.</div>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the more logical and less artificial way of
putting the rights of the agent is the alternative suggested
by <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>—his right to indemnity. The “authority
coupled with an interest” seems rather too wide, seeing that
the agent has an interest in making the bet directly the
instructions are given; yet the judgments seem to recognise
that the authority could have been withdrawn before the
bet was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case has lately been decided by the Court of Appeal.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c015'><sup>[145]</sup></a>
<span class='sc'>Bowen</span> and <span class='sc'>Fry, L.JJ.</span>, affirming the decision of
<span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, <span class='sc'>Brett, M.R.</span>, dissenting. The grounds upon
which the <span class='sc'>Master of the Rolls</span> bases his judgment are
that, although an authority might imply an authority to
pay, yet, as betting contracts were void, and as the only
inconvenience to the agent consists in his being barred from
pursuing a calling to which the law wholly objects, no
promise could be implied that such authority should not be
revoked. His lordship considered that as a matter of fact
defendant had revoked plantiff’s authority to pay; thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>differing on that point from <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span> <span class='sc'>Bowen, L.J.</span>,
treats the whole question as an inference of fact. In his
lordship’s opinion, the only inference of fact proper to be
drawn was that if the agent carried out his contract, and
involved himself in a difficulty, from which he could only
escape by paying money, the defendant was to indemnify
the plaintiff; further that the plaintiff had paid the bets by
virtue of a contract between himself and his principal, that
the latter should not revoke the original contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>His lordship therefore treats the matter somewhat differently
from <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, for it will be observed that in the
Court below, <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, treats the implied authority to
pay as an inference of fact; which was no doubt amply
justified by the previous dealings between the parties, while
he deals with the question of revocation of authority as a
matter of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, perhaps the result of the authorities may be
shortly expressed in the following way:—(1) Authority to
pay is implied in authority to bet (<i>a</i>) where the agent lays
the bet in his own name, (<i>b</i>) and where to the knowledge of
the defendant non-payment of the bet would entail serious
inconvenience to the agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That under such circumstances the authority to pay
is irrevocable directly the bet has been made.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it would seem that the cases do not expressly decide
how the law would stand in two cases. (1) Where the agent
lays the bet, not in his own name, but in that of his principal,
thus incurring no personal responsibility. (2) In cases
where the principal instructs an agent who is not a professional
betting man or not (at any rate to the knowledge of
the principal) in any other way connected with the turf so
as to incur such penalties for default as the plaintiff in
<i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i> would have incurred. Would the risk of
mere social obloquy give the agent such an interest in
paying the bet, as to make the authority to pay irrevocable?
or supposing the agent belonged to a club, a fact which was
unknown to the principal, by the rules of which the committee
were empowered to expel any of its members who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>failed to discharge debts of honour. It will be observed
that in nearly all the cases alluded to above that the
principal’s knowledge, actual or implied, of the agent’s
responsibility, was the ground of inferring an authority to
pay from the authority bet. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Agent’s
authority revocable
before
bet made.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of course this question of
revocation only arises after the bet has been made, when
the responsibility of the agent has attached. There is no
doubt, as remarked by <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, in <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>, that
the agent’s authority might have been revoked before the
bet was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>In actions against the agent as in <i>Bridges</i> v. <i>Savage</i>,<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c015'><sup>[146]</sup></a> the
defence of wagering and gaming is often raised, <i>i.e.</i>, that the
person to whom the instructions were given had acted not as
agent but as a party to the wager. In the former case it
was raised by the principal, who was sued for indemnity; in
the latter by the agent, who was called upon to account for
winnings. To avoid such difficulties in future it would be
wise both for persons who employ commission agents, and
for the latter who execute commissions, to have the terms of
their bargain definitely in writing. “Please back &#8196;&#8196; for
me,” “Taken for you,” seem to form a contract of agency
on which no such question could arise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What agent must prove.</div>

<p class='c007'>Of course the agent must prove that the payment made to
the winner of the bet was an authorised payment. In none
of the cases as between principal and agent has any dispute
arisen either as to whether the bet remained valid to the end,
or whether the horse really lost or won. It is however, by
no means impossible that such questions might be put in
issue. Supposing after the bet was made the nominator of
the horse, in respect of which the bet was made, died, so that
(at any rate according to the new Rules of Betting) the bet
would be off, or supposing defendant had instructed plaintiff
to back horse A; horse B is placed first by the judge and
A second, but B is disqualified afterwards for reasons which
would cause the bets to go with the stakes.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c015'><sup>[147]</sup></a> It is obvious
that if the agent paid on this as for losses he could not recover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>from his principal. The real point of difficulty is on what
evidence the Court would act. It is submitted (1) That the
employment of an agent to make bets in a betting market
implies an authority to bet according to the rules and usages
of such market, and that the Court would look at the Rules
of Betting or other document proved to regulate such transactions.
(2) That in all bets the question whether a horse is
the winner or the loser is impliedly to be determined by the
Rules and Conditions under which the particular race is run.
We shall hereafter, page 74, deal more fully with the term
“winner,” but it will be noticed all the cases thereunder
were decided on a construction of the Rules and Conditions.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c015'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gaming Amendment Act, 1892.</div>

<p class='c007'>But the law respecting the rights of the agent against his
principal has lately been materially altered by the Gaming
Amendment Act, 1892, 55 Vict., c. 9. This Act provides that
“any promise express or implied to pay any person any sum
of money paid by him under, or in respect of any contract or
agreement rendered null and void by the Act 8 &#38; 9, Vict., c.
109, or to pay any sum of money by way of commission fee,
reward or otherwise in respect of any such contract, or of
any services relating thereto or in connection therewith shall
be null and void, and no action shall be brought to recover
such sum of money.” Of course the cases already dealt with
will still apply to transactions which took effect before this
statute came into operation. But as to dealings between
principal and agent to which the act applies, <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>
can no longer have any application. As has been pointed
out above, the principal’s right of action against his agent to
recover winnings remains untouched.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Agent cannot recover from third party.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Britten</i> v. <i>Cook</i><a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c015'><sup>[149]</sup></a> the plaintiff made bets on behalf of
his principal with defendant, which bets he won. Plaintiff
not having received the money from defendant, settled with
his principal for the amount, because he would have
been subjected to disagreeable consequences if he did not,
and sued the defendant for the amount. <i>Held</i> that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>being no express request by defendant to plaintiff to pay on
his behalf, and no implied request, seeing plaintiff was not
defendant’s agent, the action would not lie.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No action shall be brought, &#38;c.</div>

<p class='c007'>II. The next class of cases to consider are those which
deal with the interpretation of that part of section 18 of the
Act in question, which provides that “no action shall be
brought or maintained in any Court of Law or Equity, for
recovering any sum of money or valuable thing alleged to
be won upon any wager, or which shall have been deposited
in the hands of any person to abide the event on which any
wager shall have been made.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Right to recover from stakeholder.</div>

<p class='c007'>Nearly all the questions which have arisen on this part
of the section relate to the right of a party to a wager to
recover his stakes from a stakeholder with whom both
parties have deposited their stakes. Such questions are of
course entirely distinct from the right of the winner to recover
the whole stakes from the stakeholder, as they usually
occur when one party desires to repudiate the wager, and
brings his action before the stakeholder has paid over the
money to the winner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases before the statute illegal wagers.</div>

<p class='c007'>Before the statute 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, some wagers were
legal, some illegal. With respect to illegal wagers it seems
never to have been questioned, but that one party could at
any time before the money was paid over to the winner
revoke the authority of the stakeholder, and demand back
his stakes. All the cases recognise the distinction between
recovering stakes from a stakeholder and recovering on the
wager itself.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c015'><sup>[150]</sup></a> And in <i>Hastelow</i> v. <i>Jackson</i> it seems to have
been considered that where one of the parties to the wager
considering himself to be the winner demanded the whole of
the stakes from the stakeholder, whereas the other party
had really been decided to be the winner, such demand was
a sufficient revocation of the stakeholder’s authority to pay
his stake over to the winner. But this decision was doubted
in <i>Mearing</i> v. <i>Hellings</i>.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c015'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Legal wagers.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>But with respect to wagers which were legal the decisions
were not uniform. Thus in <i>Eltham</i> v. <i>Kingsman</i><a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c015'><sup>[152]</sup></a> it was
held that where two parties to a wager had deposited two
watches to abide the event of a wager, which was for the
purposes of the case assumed to be a legal wager, either of
the parties could, while the contract was executory, revoke
the authority of the stakeholder and recover his watch in
trover. The Court compared the authority of a stakeholder
to that of an arbitrator which was clearly countermandable
before he had given his decision. On the other hand, in the
later case of <i>Emery</i> v. <i>Richards</i>,<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c015'><sup>[153]</sup></a> where the plaintiff sued a
stakeholder to recover his deposit on a legal foot-race (the
sum deposited being under £10). <i>Held</i> that as the contract
was not illegal under the Statutes of Charles II. and Anne,
neither party could retract without the consent of the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>All such questions as to the right to recover a deposit from
a stakeholder have, since the passing of the Statute 8 &#38; 9
Vict., c. 109, turned out on the construction of the words
“no action shall be brought,” &#38;c. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Statute only
applies to
actions by
winner.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There is a long series of
decisions to the effect that this provision only applies to
actions brought by the winner of a wager either against a
stakeholder or against the loser to recover his winnings, and
does not prevent either party from revoking the authority of
the stakeholder before the money is paid over to the winner,
and suing to recover his stakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Varney</i> v. <i>Hickman</i>,<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c015'><sup>[154]</sup></a> plaintiff and one Isaacs agreed
to bet £20 on a race to be run between their respective
horses, the stakes being deposited with defendant. Before
the race the plaintiff declined the bet and demanded back
his deposit. On behalf of defendant it was contended that it
was an action within the meaning of the section. <span class='sc'>Maule, J.</span>,
in giving judgment, discussed the effect of the part of the
section. “The first part of the section,” he says, “declares
the contract to be null and void; the second prevents the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>winner from bringing an action to recover the amount of the
bet from the loser; the third prevents the winner from suing
the stakeholder. It certainly is true that the second branch is
involved in the first, <i>i.e.</i>, if the section had stopped at the
end of the first branch it would have followed that no action
could be brought to enforce a contract so declared to be void.
But I apprehend there is nothing unusual in an Act of Parliament
stating a legal consequence in this way. Then the
third branch of the clause, it is said, will be idle and insensible
unless there be given to it the further effect of prohibiting
the parties from recovering their deposits from the
stakeholder upon the repudiation of the illegal contract....
But I think if the second branch of the clause
be looked at, it is more consistent with the whole to treat
the third as an exposition only of the first....
Although perhaps the third clause might have been omitted
as well as the second, yet, the second being inserted, the third
became necessary also. Looking, therefore, at the whole
section, critically and grammatically, I am of opinion that it
does not apply to an action like this, where a party seeks to
recover <i>his deposit</i> from a stakeholder, upon a repudiation of
the wager. Upon higher grounds also, I think that is the
true construction of the Act. This cannot be considered as
an action brought for recovering a sum of money alleged to
be won upon a wager; nor do I think it is an action brought
to recover a sum deposited in the hands of the defendant to
<i>abide</i> the event of a wager. As soon as the defendant
received notice from the plaintiff that he declined to abide
by the wager, the money ceased to be money deposited in
the hands of the former to abide the event, and became
money of the plaintiff in his hands without any good reason
for detaining it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hewson</i>,<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c015'><sup>[155]</sup></a> where money had been deposited to
abide the event of a cock-fight, it was held that the words
“no action shall be brought,” &#38;c., did not apply where the
original object of the deposit has been revoked by the
depositor; and that (assuming cock-fighting to be illegal)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>either depositor could <i>before the event</i>, revoke the stakeholder’s
authority and recover his stake.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Notice necessary to determine stakeholder’s authority.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Gatty</i> v. <i>Field</i><a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c015'><sup>[156]</sup></a> it was held that it was necessary to serve
the stakeholder with a notice to determine his agency before
bringing the action; this would seem to follow from the
remarks of <span class='sc'>Maule, J.</span>, in <i>Varney</i> v. <i>Hickman</i> that the effect
of the notice was to change the character of the deposit. So
in <i>Savage</i> v. <i>Madder</i>,<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c015'><sup>[157]</sup></a> to which allusion has been made above on
another point; to an action for money had and received the
defendant pleaded (<i><span lang="la">inter al.</span></i>): “That the money was deposited
in the hands of the defendant to abide the event on which
the wager was made and is claimed by the plaintiff as the
winner of the said wager, and the plaintiff did not repudiate
the said wager or demand back his said money <i>before
the event of the said wager</i>.” The Court were unanimously
of opinion that this was a good plea; but from the form
the plea assumed the case cannot be said to decide that one
depositor can revoke the stakeholder’s authority; indeed an
observation of <span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span> (at p. 180), would seem to imply
that section 18 prohibited all actions against the stakeholder
at all. It only shows that, at any rate where the
wager has not been repudiated, the money retains its
character of money deposited to abide the event. The plea,
moreover, seems framed upon the assumption that the
revocation must take place before the event and not merely
before the money is paid over, as was also suggested in
<i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hewson</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation of stakeholder to depositors.</div>

<p class='c007'>The great difficulty in these cases seems to have arisen
from the want of a proper understanding of the real relation
in which a stakeholder stands to persons who deposit money
in his hands. This question was much discussed in <i>Hampden</i>
v. <i>Walsh</i>.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c015'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Plaintiff and Wallace deposited £500 each with
defendant, as stakeholder, on an agreement that if Wallace
should by a certain date prove to the satisfaction of the
defendant the truth of some scientific proposition, Wallace
should receive the two sums deposited. Defendant decided
in Wallace’s favor. Plaintiff objected to the decision, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>before the money was paid over to Wallace demanded repayment
of his deposit from defendant. In spite of this
notice defendant paid the whole to Wallace. <span class='sc'>Cockburn,
C. J.</span>, in delivering judgment, alludes to this particular
point, which had evidently been dealt with in argument:
“We cannot concur in what is said in ‘Chitty on Contracts,’
8th edition, p. 574, that ‘a stakeholder is the agent of both
parties, or rather their trustee.’ It may be true that he is
the trustee of both parties in a certain sense, so that, if the
event comes off and the authority to pay over the money by
the depositor be not revoked, he may be bound to pay it
over. But primarily he is the agent of the depositor, and
can deal with the money deposited so long as his authority
subsists. We should look upon the defendant merely as the
agent of the plaintiff and as no longer justified in paying
over the money when once his authority had been countermanded.”
The Court held plaintiff entitled to recover, and
the case seems to go one step further than previous cases on
the statute in showing that the stakeholder’s authority may
be countermanded after, as well as before, the event has
came off, as in <i>Hastelow</i> v. <i>Jackson</i>.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c015'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The same view seems to have been taken of the matter by
the Irish Courts.<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c015'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These decisions afterwards were supported, first by the
Court of Exchequer Chambers, and next by the Privy
Council. In <i>Diggle</i> v. <i>Higgs</i>,<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c015'><sup>[161]</sup></a> plaintiff and A agreed to
walk a match for £200 a side, that sum to be deposited by
each with defendant. A was declared winner; but before
the money was paid over plaintiff gave notice to defendant
not to pay to A. Defendant disregarded the notice and
plaintiff sued to recover his stakes. The Court were unanimous
in upholding the authority of the previous decisions.
<span class='sc'>Cockburn, C. J.</span>, however, who had in <i>Hampden</i> v. <i>Walsh</i>
hinted a doubt as to the correctness of the authorities, here
expressly intimates, that if the matter were <i><span lang="la">res integra</span></i>, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>would have thought that the words of the statute precluded
an action to recover even a deposit; but that he was unwilling
to disturb the law as settled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, L. J.</span>, touching on the meaning of the words
“no action shall be brought,” thinks that they are wholly
superfluous and might have been left out. It will be
remembered that <span class='sc'>Maule, J.</span>, in <i>Varney</i> v. <i>Hickman</i>, looked
upon them as a statement of legal consequence, not strictly
necessary, but intended by way of explanation of the results
of the general enactment. It seems, however, not improbable
that the words were inserted to prevent any question arising
as to the right of the winner to recover from the stakeholder
on a count for money received to his use—a point
which would have presented more difficulty than an action
by the winner against the loser, and which might have been
made a means of evading the Act, by doing through the
interposition of a stakeholder what could not be done
directly. It being thought advisable to provide for the one
case, the other more obvious provision would be inserted for
the sake of completeness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be unnecessary to refer to <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Hill</i>,<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c015'><sup>[162]</sup></a> further
than to say that the same point was decided in the same way.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c015'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It seems, therefore, to be clearly settled law, subject only
to reversal by the House of Lords, that a stakeholder holds
each stake as agent for the depositor and that a depositor
can recall his stake at any time before it is paid over to the
winner, whether before or after the event has been decided.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Qy. Where
horse
disqualified.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was, however, held in two cases<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c015'><sup>[164]</sup></a> that where the owner
entered a horse that was afterwards disqualified he could not
recover his stakes on the ground that he would be playing a
game of heads I win, tails you lose. But it is very doubtful
whether these decisions would be supported at the present
day considering the bias of the more recent cases.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>His authority may be determined in the same way as that
of an ordinary agent—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Determination of stakeholder’s authority.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) By express notice of revocation, as in all the cases
quoted above.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Where the objects for which the deposit was made
have, to the knowledge of the stakeholder, become impossible
of performance. Thus in <i>Carr</i> v. <i>Martinson</i><a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c015'><sup>[165]</sup></a> where stakes
had been deposited with defendant to abide the event of a
horse-race between the plaintiff and one C, the race to be
decided by a person named as judge, C on the day appointed
did not appear and A’s horse walked over the course, and
was decided by the judge to be the winner. Plaintiff demanded
the whole of the stakes from the defendant, which
defendant refused to pay except with the consent of C.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Held</i>, that as soon as the race became impossible to the
knowledge of the defendant, he held the stake <i><span lang="la">eo instanti</span></i> as
money had and received to the use of the defendant, the
defendant’s authority to pay the winner being thereby revoked;
and that although plaintiff demanded the whole of
the stakes as winner, yet that was a sufficient demand of his
own stake, which defendant ought to have handed over.
Per Lord <span class='sc'>Campbell, C. J.</span>, a demand was unnecessary in
this case at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Death of principal.</div>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Probably by the death of one of the depositors.
That is the general rule in ordinary transactions between
principal and agent, that the authority of the agent is revoked
by the principal’s death. This point occurred, but
was not taken in <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Purcell</i>.<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c015'><sup>[166]</sup></a> Testator had
deposited with two stakeholders a sum of money to abide
the result of bets made by himself. It appeared from the
evidence that a bet is always “off” on the death of one of
the parties. On testator’s death the stakeholders repaid the
deposit to his administratrix. One question raised in the
case was whether this deposit passed under a gift in the will
of all testator’s “money.” The Court held that it did not,
as although, according to <i>Varney</i> v. <i>Hickman</i>, testator had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>power to revoke the stakeholders’ authority, he had not in
his lifetime exercised this right: therefore the deposit was
in no sense his moneys, though since his death it had become
part of his assets. The point was not taken that the principal’s
death of itself revoked the stakeholders’ authority,
though that result seems to have been arrived at by means
of the custom among betting men. But, as Lord Justice
Bruce seems to imply, that if testator had before his death
given notice to the stakeholders to return the deposit, it
might then have been considered his money, it is not easy to
see why the same result should not follow from a revocation
by operation of law.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that it has been suggested above
(p. 36) that the deposit of stakes by the competitors in a
race is the same thing legally as the deposit in respect of an
ordinary bet. If it be true, therefore, that the death of a
depositor revokes the authority of the stakeholder with
respect to that particular stake, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Right of
executors
against stakeholders.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
it would seem that where a
competitor in a race happens to die between the time of
paying his stake or forfeit and the time when the whole is
paid to the winner strictly speaking and from a legal point
of view the stakeholder should repay them to his representatives,
seeing that by Rule 156 of the Rules of Racing
stakes and forfeits are part of the fund payable to the winner.
The same would apply to entrance money where, according
to Rule 160, it is payable to the winner as part of the stakes.
But, of course, entrance money would not be part of the
stakes where, as is usual, it is paid into the race fund.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bankruptcy.</div>

<p class='c007'>(4.) As a general rule the authority of an agent (<i>i.e.</i>, a bare
authority not coupled with an interest) is revoked by the
bankruptcy<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c015'><sup>[167]</sup></a> of the principal. Although there seems to be
no express decision on the point, it seems probable that the
same rule would apply in the case of a stakeholder where
either of the depositors became bankrupt before the money
was paid over to the winner. As the stakeholder is, according
to <i>Hampden</i> v. <i>Walsh</i>,<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c015'><sup>[168]</sup></a> merely the agent for each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>depositor, the safest plan for him to adopt on receiving
notice of a depositor’s bankruptcy would be to consider his
authority as to that stake revoked, and repay it to the
trustee in bankruptcy; or perhaps he would be safe in
paying it to the bankrupt himself, if the trustee had not
intervened to claim it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stakeholder cannot sue for stakes.</div>

<p class='c007'>As the stakeholder is merely the agent for the depositors,
he cannot maintain an action for the stakes. Thus, in
<i>Charlton</i> v. <i>Hill</i><a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c015'><sup>[169]</sup></a> the Clerk of the Course of a race meeting,
who was sued by the plaintiff for the stakes won by him in
one race, attempted to set off against that claim a sum due
from plaintiff in respect of the stakes of another race. <i>Held</i>,
that he could not do so as no action could have been maintained
by the defendant seeing that the plaintiff could at
any time recover the stakes back again.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Competitors can choose their own stakeholder.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is, moreover, competent to the competitors to choose
their own stakeholder or to select a substitute for the one
nominated by the rules of the race. Thus, in <i>Dines</i> v.
<i>Wolf</i><a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c015'><sup>[170]</sup></a> by the rules of the race the stakes should have been
paid to the Treasurer of the Australian Jockey Club, but
plaintiff insisted on their being retained by the defendant.
<i>Held</i>, therefore, that plaintiff could not make defendant
liable as he had acquiesced in the change.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Liability of steward for default of stakeholder.</div>

<p class='c007'>A question has occasionally been raised whether a steward
who nominates a stakeholder can be made liable for the
latter’s insolvency or default. It is difficult to see how he
could be without express agreement, or perhaps unless he
wilfully appointed a man unfit for the post.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Liability of stakeholder.</div>

<p class='c007'>The stakeholder should be very careful before he pays the
stakes to the winner to ascertain that the winner has been
so declared by a competent authority, seeing that if he pays
and it turns out that the judge, umpire, or stewards have
not acted in accordance with his or their authority, he may
be liable to the other subscribers. See <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Sadler</i>.<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c015'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>When responsible for stakes.</div>

<p class='c007'>By Rule 28 of the Rules of Racing the clerk of the course,
who is generally the stakeholder, is responsible for the stakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>if he allows a horse to start in respect of which the stakes
have not been paid. This seems to be a liability in the
nature of a guarantee of a wager, seeing that the liability
for stakes is simply the liability on a wager.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Guarantee of a wager.</div>

<p class='c007'>There seems no reason why an action should not be maintained
in a contract by one person to guarantee the due
performance of a wager contract by another. Such a contract
could not of itself be void as a wager seeing that
the statutes as we have seen only apply to the parties to
the wager itself. Probably, it would have to be in writing
to satisfy the Statute of Frauds as being a promise to answer
for the <i>default</i> of another, but this is by no means certain
seeing that it is not a default in paying a legal demand. If
the contract be held to be within the Statute of Frauds the
stakeholder ought to be required to sign an acceptance of
the post, subject to the Rules of Racing, so that he may be
subject to the liability provided by Rule 28.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Forfeit or penalty not enforceable.</div>

<p class='c007'>As no action will lie on a wager, so no action can be
brought to enforce a penalty for non-performance of a
wager. In <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Osborne</i><a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c015'><sup>[172]</sup></a> the plaintiff and defendant
agreed each to nominate a mare for a race, the party or
parties nominating the winner to receive from the parties or
party nominating the other mare the sum of £100; the
party or parties who should make default in nominating a
mare to pay a forfeit to the other side of £100. Defendants
failed to cause their mare to run and plaintiff sued to recover
£100 penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Held</i>, that it could not be recovered, as the agreement was
a mere wager. “If the agreement be legal there is no
obstacle to prevent the recovery of the penalty for non-performance,
but if illegal the penalty can no more be
recovered than damages for non-performance.”<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c015'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It has been shewn above, p. 36, that no action will lie to
recover stakes from any of the competitors in a horse race,
a sweepstakes being on the same footing as any other game
for money. This decision would therefore show that what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>are known as “forfeits” in racing, <i>i.e.</i>, sums payable in
withdrawing a horse from the race, frequently half the stake
(see Rule of Racing 105) are equally irrecoverable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deposits on bets.</div>

<p class='c007'>It may here be convenient to consider the rights of the
parties with respect to money deposited by one party with
the other on bets made between the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Purcell</i>,<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c015'><sup>[174]</sup></a> persons who had made wagers
with the testator had deposited with him the sums they had
staked. Some of these bets were lost to the testator in his
life time, and after his death his testatrix paid the winners
both the amounts they had deposited and the amounts they
had won. Some of the bets were undecided at the time of
testator’s death, and in respect of these the executrix repaid
the depositors the amount of their deposits.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was proved that by the custom among betting men
bets are off on the death of one of the parties. It was held
that in respect of bets decided against testator in his life
time, the executrix was not justified in paying either the
sum won or the deposit; but that as to the bets which had
not been decided, she was justified in repaying the deposits.
<span class='sc'>Knight Bruce, L. J.</span>, put the case on the ground that the
contract being illegal, the executrix was justified in determining
the bets before they came off. It is difficult to
justify the first part of this decision relating to the deposits
on the bets which had been decided in testator’s life time.
A makes a ready money bet with a book maker at 5 to 1,
depositing the £1 with him. A’s horse wins; A of course
cannot recover the £5, but why not the £1? The truth
seems to be that the deposit is made as a security for what A
might lose to B on the bet, an event which became impossible.
The fallacy seems to be treating the betting contract
as illegal; no doubt if A had lost the bet he could not have
recovered the deposit (see, however, p. 66).</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Reggio</i> v. <i>Stevens</i>,<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c015'><sup>[175]</sup></a> the plaintiff had deposited
sums of money with the defendants in respect of stock
exchange transactions which he intended to open at the
defendant’s office. These transactions being for differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>were held by the Court to be wagering contracts (see <i>post</i>
on the Chapter on Stock Exchange). The plaintiff, as he was
by the agreement entitled to do, gave notice to close the
transactions, which showed a balance in his favour, at the
same time demanding the winnings and repayment of his
deposit.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was contended under the authority of <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Purcell</i>,
that inasmuch as the notice to close the transaction was in
effect determined the wager, the deposit could be recovered.
The Court held that inasmuch as the money had been
deposited in respect, not of one, but of a series of transactions,
the case came under the second part of <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Purcell</i>,
and that the deposit could be recovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>By sect. 5 of the Act of 1853: “Any money or valuable
thing received by any such person as aforesaid, as a deposit on
any bet, or as or for the consideration for any such assurance,
undertaking, promise, or agreement as aforesaid, shall be
deemed to have been received to or for the use of the person
from whom the same was received, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Deposit with
keeper of
betting house.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and such money or valuable
thing or the value thereof may be recovered accordingly with
full costs of suit.” It is obvious that the section is hardly intelligible
without reference to the other sections of the Act, which
will be found set out in the Chapter on Betting Houses. In
<i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i>,<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c015'><sup>[176]</sup></a> the defendant was in the habit of standing
by a tree in Hyde Park, making bets with other persons.
The plaintiff deposited a sum of money with the defendant in
respect of one of these bets, which sum plaintiff now sued to
recover. The majority of the Court held that the “person
aforesaid,” in section 5, alluded to the persons specified in
section 4, <i>i.e.</i>, the owner or occupier of the place, &#38;c., or
person acting on his behalf, or having the care or management
of the business. That the section did not include any
“person using the same,” and that as the defendant could
not be said to be the owner or occupier of any place in Hyde
Park, the section did not apply.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will, however, be noticed that the section speaks of a
deposit (1) on any bet, (2) as or for the consideration for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>assurance as aforesaid. Now the assurance spoken of in the
previous section refers only to an agreement to pay on the
contingency of a horse-race or other sport. It would seem,
therefore, that while the penal provisions of section 4 are
confined to deposits on bets on horse-races, &#38;c., <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Does s. 5
apply to bets
in stocks and
shares?<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the right of
action given by section 5 to recover deposits on any bet
applies to bets of every kind, and therefore to wagering
transactions, &#38;c., on stocks and shares. It is to transactions
of the latter kind that this question would have a practical
application. In the outside Stock Exchange places, commonly
known as “bucket shops,” bargains for differences
(which are really wagers) are well known. (See <i>post</i>, the
Chapter on Stock Exchange).</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point which would seem somewhat doubtful
under the section is, supposing a deposit be made within
the section, <i>i.e.</i>, with the owner or occupier, &#38;c., of the place
kept for the unlawful purpose, and the bet is determined
against the depositor, can he still recover this as a deposit
on the bet, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>After bet lost
to depositor.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
even though the money ceases to retain its
character as a deposit, and has been appropriated to the
payment of a lost bet? It would seem that he could. The
Act was passed to discourage and penalize establishments of
a specified kind. Besides, it would seem that even before the
Act, according to <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Purcell</i> (<i><span lang="la">ubi sup.</span></i>) money
deposited on a bet can in all cases be recovered before the
event, so that for this purpose the Act was unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>At all events, before an action can be brought under this
section at all, the following circumstances must combine:
(1) Receipt of money on deposit (2) by the owner or occupier
(or his agent or manager in the betting business) (3) of
a place, etc., kept or used for the purposes mentioned in
sections 1 and 3. As to this and “place” and “user,”
see the Chapter on Betting Houses; but (4) it is at p. 190
pointed out that the receipt under section 4 need not be
in the house or place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Foreign law.</div>

<p class='c007'>The insertion of the clause commencing with the words,
“no action shall be brought,” may, perhaps, have a practical
significance in one case, where an action is brought in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>England on a wager-contract made in a foreign country
where such contracts are enforceable.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be sufficient for present purposes to state a few
general rules which prevail in a case of what is called a
conflict of laws:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Where a contract contemplates any particular country
as the place of performance, the contract is governed by the
law of that country, the <i><span lang="la">lex loci solutionis</span></i>; <i>e.g.</i>, the liability
of the acceptor and indorser of a bill of exchange, drawn
and accepted in France, but accepted payable in England,
must be decided according to the law of England.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c015'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><i>Robinson</i> v. <i>Bland</i><a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c015'><sup>[178]</sup></a> is an example of a bill accepted for
gaming debts contracted abroad. Plaintiff sued on an acceptance
given in France, payable in England, for money
lost at play in France. The acceptor died before action
brought. It appeared that the debt could only have been
enforced in France by the marshals in a court of honour and
not in the ordinary courts, and the only process ultimately
available was personal attachment, which in the present case
would have been impossible as the debtor was dead. So as
the debt could not have been enforced in France, no action
would lie here. According to English law the bill was void
by the Statute of Anne.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Where no special place of performance is named, the
<i><span lang="la">lex loci contractus</span></i> prevails, that is, the law of the place where
the contract is made; or in the case of an executed contract,
where the transaction is carried out; <i>e.g.</i>, money advanced in
France for the purposes of gaming is a transaction governed
by French law.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c015'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Quarrier</i> v. <i>Coulston</i>,<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c015'><sup>[180]</sup></a> a bill was filed by the personal
representative of a deceased person to have an I O U given
to defendant by deceased delivered up to be cancelled, on the
ground that it was given in respect of money won from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>deceased at cards, or lent to him for gaming purposes, while
travelling on the Continent at Baden-Baden and other places
in Germany. Judgment was given for the defendants, on
the ground that it did not appear that the games were
unlawful by the laws of the country where the money was
won.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The formalities necessary for a contract must be
decided by the law of the place where the contract is
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) Questions of procedure are decided according to the
law of the forum where the case is tried.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Leroux</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c015'><sup>[181]</sup></a> it was decided the words in the
4th section of the Statute of Frauds, which provide that “no
action shall be brought” upon certain contracts therein
specified unless there be some memorandum of them in
writing, refer to procedure only, and do not affect the substance
of the contract; consequently, where an action was
brought in England on a verbal contract entered into in
France, where no writing was required, but which by the
4th section of the Statute of Frauds ought to have been in
writing in England, it was held that as the Statute of Frauds
referred to procedure only, the law of England must prevail
where the action was brought, and that the rule above stated
as to the formalities did not apply.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Qy. Effect words in 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</div>

<p class='c007'>It may be, therefore, that the same words used in 8 &#38; 9
Vict., c. 109, section 18, would have the same effect, viz., in
preventing an action being brought in English Courts on a
wager-contract entered into abroad in a country where they
are legally enforceable.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c015'><sup>[182]</sup></a> This, of course, would not apply to
money lent for gaming purposes,<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c015'><sup>[183]</sup></a> which depends on 5 &#38; 6
William IV. and not on 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109. (See <i>ante</i> p. 14.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The “Proviso.”</div>

<p class='c007'>III. We now come to the last part of the section, commonly
called the “Proviso,” which says that “this enactment shall
not be deemed to apply to any subscription or contribution,
or agreement to subscribe or contribute for or towards any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>plate, prize, or sum of money to be awarded to the winner or
winners of any lawful game, sport, pastime, or exercise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three series of questions on this proviso.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. As to what is “a subscription or contribution to a
prize”?</p>

<p class='c017'>II. As to when a person is “the winner” within the
statute?</p>

<p class='c017'>III. What are lawful games, sports, &#38;c.?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Subscription or contribution.</div>

<p class='c007'>I. What is the meaning of a subscription or contribution
to a prize?</p>

<p class='c007'>In many of the cases the line is very fine between such
subscription and a deposit of sweepstakes. In <i>Batty</i> v.
<i>Marriott</i>,<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c015'><sup>[184]</sup></a> a foot-race was agreed upon between plaintiff and
A for £10 a side, and each deposited £10 with the defendant
as stakeholder. A was declared winner, but plaintiff disputed
the decision and demanded back his stakes. The
Court held that the provisions of 16 Car. II. and 9 Anne
relating to the question, were repealed by 8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109; and that although the contract was in the nature of
a wager, still the Act laid down no rule with respect to the
number of subscribers necessary to form “a subscription to a
prize.” It made no difference between the case of two or
fifty. They all intimated that their decision went farther
than the Legislature intended to go—consequently, as a foot-race
is a lawful game, and as one party who has paid money
on a legal contract cannot recall it without the consent of the
others, they held that the plaintiff could not recover his stake.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this case were good law, it would follow that the real
test to be applied is, whether or not the money were deposited
before the event came off in the hands of a stakeholder.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the decision was not regarded with much favour in
the later case of <i>Parsons</i> v. <i>Alexander</i>.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c015'><sup>[185]</sup></a> Plaintiff sued on an
account stated for money which had been won at billiards.
Defendant having, to start with, a few shillings in his pocket
played the plaintiff for a certain sum and lost. They then
played again for “double or quits,” and defendant was
again unsuccessful. This was repeated until the defendant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>lost to the plaintiff about £65, for which he gave an I O U.
The Court, while intimating doubts as to the correctness of
<i>Batty</i> v. <i>Marriott</i>, distinguished the case before them on the
ground that the parties had played entirely on credit, and
had not, as in <i>Batty</i> v. <i>Marriott</i>, deposited the stakes before
the event came off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Per <span class='sc'>Erle, J.</span>: “The distinction is between gaming and
cases where a person either pays down a contribution to a
stake, or holds himself forth as having contributed.” Per
<span class='sc'>Crampton, J.</span>: “This was an agreement, if you win, I pay
you; if you lose, you pay me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This distinction suggested by the Court of cases where the
money is actually deposited by the parties who play, and
cases where it is not, seems also to have occurred to <span class='sc'>Maule,
J.</span>, in <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Lansley</i>:<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c015'><sup>[186]</sup></a> “The 18th section seems to treat
the money which is in a man’s pocket at the time as the reasonable
limit to which he may lawfully gamble.” So, too, under
the older statutes of Charles II. and Anne, as interpreted by
<i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i>, there was no objection to gaming so
long as the stakes were prepaid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the Court said that but for <i>Batty</i> v. <i>Marriott</i>,
they would have thought the proviso was confined to subscriptions
by outside parties to a prize, and not to deposits
by the players themselves. In <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Overbury</i>,<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c015'><sup>[187]</sup></a> the
plaintiff was a subscriber to a race. The stewards could
not agree as to the winner. Plaintiff claimed that his
horse had won, and brought an action against the stakeholder
to recover the stakes, thereby submitting the decision
of the race to the jury. At the trial it was contended that
he was, at all events, entitled to recover his own contribution.
It was not even argued that this case was within
the “proviso” as a contribution to a prize. The Court
held that as it had not been shown that it had become
impossible to obtain the decision of the stewards, he could
not call on the stakeholder to return his contribution.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Irwin</i> v. <i>Osborne</i>,<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c015'><sup>[188]</sup></a> plaintiff agreed with the defendants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>that a match should be run between a mare, the property of
M, and a mare the property of the plaintiff; that the party
who nominated the winner should receive from the party or
parties nominating the other mare the sum of £100; and
that if either party who nominated a mare should make
default in causing such mare to run, he or they should pay
the other party £100. The defendants made such default,
and plaintiff sued for £100. The Court held that this was
not within the proviso of the statute; there was “no subscription;
no contribution; no deposit. This action has
been brought, not for a contribution, but to recover a
penalty.... For the amount is not made up by a
contribution or money deposited, and the winner had to
depend on his good fortune in nominating the successful
horse.... The contract depended on an accidental circumstance,
not on the running of a race.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Per <span class='sc'>Crampton, J.</span>: “If it be an ordinary wager it is
unlawful; all betting is disallowed, but an exception is made
on what I may call a particular species of wagering, namely,
a number of persons making a fund, the whole of which is
to become the property of the successful party.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear that in this case the test of prepayment of stakes
was adopted by the Court, following <i>Batty</i> v. <i>Marriott</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Crofton</i> v. <i>Colgan</i> it seems to have been assumed that
a subscription to a race by all the owners of the horses
running, and a further sum added by the stewards of the
race was within the proviso; but the real dispute in this
case was on the meaning of the term “winner,” which will
be fully discussed hereafter. So the case is of no great
value in laying down any test or principle for determining
what amounts to “subscription” or “prize.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Coombes</i> v. <i>Dibble</i>,<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c015'><sup>[189]</sup></a> plaintiff and defendant agreed to
ride a race on their own horses, the winner to keep both
horses as his own property. <i>Held</i> that this was not within
the proviso, as there was in no sense a contribution to a
prize. Neither party could be said to “contribute” their
horses if they won. <span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span>, however, suggested that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>if a horse had been placed in the custody of a stakeholder
before the race came off, that might have been in the nature
of a contribution to a prize within the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far the balance of authority seems to have been in
favour of the decision in <i>Batty</i> v. <i>Marriott</i> and the test
therein suggested, the only dicta to the contrary were
the remarks made by some of the judges in <i>Parsons</i> v.
<i>Alexander</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the point has now been decided the other way by the
Court of Appeal and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, in two cases to which we have alluded above on
another point, viz., <i>Diggle</i> v. <i>Higgs</i><a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c015'><sup>[190]</sup></a> and <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Hill</i>.<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c015'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
In <i>Diggle</i> v. <i>Higgs</i>, in addition to the point decided above,
it was contended for the defendant that the deposits were
in the nature of a contribution to a prize; but the Court
held—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) That the agreement was a mere wager, in spite
of the fact that the money was deposited with a stake
holder;</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That the proviso in favour of subscription to a prize
was only meant to apply to agreements which were not in the
nature of wagers. Per Lord <span class='sc'>Cairns, L. C.</span>: “It is clear
that there may be in scores of forms ‘subscriptions or
contributions’ towards a plate or prize without there being
any wager, and I cannot read this proviso, which has a
natural and intelligible meaning, in a different way, any one
which would have the effect of neutralizing the enactment....
I read the proviso thus: ‘Provided that so long
as there is a subscription which is not a wager, the second
part of the section shall not apply.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) That the enactment avoiding wagers apply to all
wagers, irrespective of the legality or illegality of the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case was afterwards followed by the Privy Council
in <i>Trimble</i> v. <i>Hill</i>.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c015'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Result of foregoing cases.</div>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing cases do not leave the matter very clearly
settled. They afford a number of illustrations of transactions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>which are <i>not</i> within the proviso as subscriptions to a prize;
and finally <i>Diggle</i> v. <i>Higgs</i> lays down the general rule that
the proviso is not intended to apply to any case which is at
all in the nature of a wager. But with the exception of the
case of <i>Crofton</i> v. <i>Colgan</i>, they do not go far towards showing
what is a subscription or contribution to a prize. It is
obvious that the exact line of distinction between a wager
and a prize is very difficult to draw. <i>Diggle</i> v. <i>Higgs</i> shows
that a mere deposit of stakes to be awarded to the winner of
a race between two persons is a wager and nothing more; a
decision that would seem to apply to the agreements in
<i>Sadler</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c015'><sup>[193]</sup></a> and <i>Dines</i> v. <i>Wolfe</i>.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c015'><sup>[194]</sup></a> In both these cases
the parties agreed to race, in one case a horse-race and in
the other a sculling race, having previously deposited stakes
with the stakeholder to be awarded to the winner, though
in the latter cases the point did not arise, as in neither of
those actions did the plaintiff show himself to be the winner.
Thus the test suggested in <i>Batty</i> v. <i>Marriott</i> is completely
rejected, viz., the distinction between cases where money is
deposited before the event and cases where it is not. Another
test, hinted by the Court in <i>Parsons</i> v. <i>Alexander</i>, was
between cases where the winnings are contributed by the
competitors themselves, and where they are given by some
outside person. If this be the true test, the result would be
that many <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> races would be placed simply on the
footing of wagers,<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c015'><sup>[195]</sup></a> at any rate so far as the right of the winner
to recover the stakes is concerned. Where the winnings
consist of sums deposited and a sum added, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Distinction
between the
stakes and a
sum added.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the case of
<i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i> shows that a distinction can be drawn
between the two; the deposits might be in the nature of
money won at gaming and so not recoverable, while it was
held that the “sum added” by some outside person was
under any circumstances recoverable by the winner. It
seems that that distinction exists under the present state
of the law, and that strictly and technically speaking, the
stakes deposited previously to a race are not recoverable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>though, no doubt, any sum of money contributed by a
stranger would be a contribution to a prize within the
proviso.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is some argument in favour of this view that section 6
of the Betting House Act exempts from the penal provisions
of the Act any “deposit of stakes.” This would have been
unnecessary if a sweepstakes were not in the nature of
a wager.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Entries, stakes, forfeit, cups.</div>

<p class='c007'>If this, as it is submitted, is the true principle, it is not
difficult to ascertain how far the different forms of prizes
given for races are recoverable, or how far they come within
the law of wagers. Thus “a plate,” which, according to the
Rules of Racing, is a prize in money not made up by subscription
among the competitors, would seem to be on the
same footing as “added money” as decided in <i>Applegarth</i>
v. <i>Colley</i>. Entrance money would be on the same footing as
the stakes in cases where, according to Rule 160, it is payable
to the winner.<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c015'><sup>[196]</sup></a> As to “forfeits,” they would seem to be,
as their name implies, in the nature of small penalties
payable for withdrawing a horse from his engagements. By
Rule 109 horses coming up in time to start are liable for
the whole stake. It has already been pointed out (<i>sup.</i> p. 63),
that such a penalty is not recoverable. A “cup” is any prize
not consisting of money. If awarded by some outside person
it would, no doubt, be within the proviso, a prize to be
awarded to the winner. But if it is obtained by subscription
among the competitors it would seem to be on the same
footing as a money fund made up of stakes, and the subscribers
would be joint owners of aliquot shares,<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c015'><sup>[197]</sup></a> until they
have all assented to its being handed over to the winner,
otherwise the statute might be evaded by the parties
purchasing a chattel with the stakes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Meaning of term “winner.”</div>

<p class='c007'>II. With respect to the term “winner,” some rather
curious points have been decided. In <i>Crofton</i> v. <i>Colgan</i>,<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c015'><sup>[198]</sup></a> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>parties subscribed £3 each in respect of their stakes, the
stewards of the race subscribing £30. There were two prizes
to be awarded. It was contended that this did not come
within the proviso as a prize to be awarded to the winner, on
the ground that the horse that came in second could not be
considered a “winner,” and, therefore, as the whole sum was
not to be awarded to the winner the statute did not apply.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>2nd horse
may be
“winner.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the Court held (1) that the term “winner” might apply
to a second horse as well as to a first;<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c015'><sup>[199]</sup></a> and (2) that, apart
from that objection, the mere fact that part of the stakes were
not to go to the winner would not take the case out of the
statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point arose in <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Newson</i>,<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c015'><sup>[200]</sup></a> where a man
called Hawkins wagered with the plaintiff, that his,
Hawkins’, horse would trot eighteen miles in one hour.
Hawkins and plaintiff deposited £50 each with defendant
as stakeholder to abide the event. The referee decided in
Hawkins’ favour, but plaintiff, disputing the decision, gave
notice to defendant to pay him back his stakes. Defendant
disregarded the notice, and paid the whole to Hawkins.
Plaintiff sued to recover his deposit. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>There must
be a “loser.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>Held</i>, that the agreement
was a mere wager; there could be no winner in such
a case as only one person was to do anything. In such a case
there could be no “loser,” and without a loser there can be no
winner. It will be remembered that in <i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i>
the same view was taken as to the meaning of the term
“winner of £10” in the Statute of Anne, and the Court there
held that a man could not be said to be a winner of £10
within the statute, unless there were a corresponding loser
of the same sum. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Winner must
be a competitor
in the
race, &#38;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It would seem, too, that a person cannot
be called a winner unless he either take some part himself in
a competition or be the owner of an animal engaged therein.
Thus, in <i>Irvine</i> v. <i>Osborne</i><a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c015'><sup>[201]</sup></a> the plaintiff and defendants simply
nominated the winner of a race, the person who nominated
the successful horse to have the stakes. Plaintiff nominated
a horse not belonging to himself. <i>Held</i>, that he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>not be a winner of the race, as “the contract depended
on some accidental circumstance, not on the winning of a race.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Breeders’ stakes.</div>

<p class='c007'>A case that seems to fall within this rule is that of breeders’
stakes, where a certain sum is, by the conditions of the
race, to be awarded to the breeder of the winner. It would
seem according to the above case that not being the owner of
the animal winning, the breeder could not recover under this
proviso of the section.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Disputes as to the winner.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious that any person suing to recover stakes as
winner has cast upon him the burthen of proving himself to
be such. The determination of such a question will generally
depend upon agreement or special conditions by which competitors
agree to be bound. Thus, horse-races are generally
run either subject to the rules of the Jockey Club, or subject
to specially advertised regulations. However, it may be
taken that the winner is declared by the judge, all further
questions or objections—as to, for instance, qualification—being
decided by the stewards.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The judge.</div>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the authority of the judge to declare the
winner, the conditions upon which it is exercisable must be
strictly observed, and the same in the case of the arbitrators
or umpires of other kinds of races. In the head note to
<i>Carr</i> v. <i>Martinson</i><a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c015'><sup>[202]</sup></a> it is stated the power of the judge of a
horse-race to award the stakes to a winner does not arise
until the race has been run! This extraordinary point arose
in the following way: the parties agreed on a race between
their respective horses, naming both a starter and a judge,
and fixing a particular hour on a certain day. The stakes
were deposited with the defendant, to be handed over to the
winner according to the decision of the judge. The parties
made their appearance, but the starter did not turn up. One
of the parties refused to run and the plaintiff walked over
the course and was declared by the judge to be the winner.
But the Court held that the presence of the starter was, by
the agreement, a condition precedent to the race, and so to
the judge’s authority. There had been no starter, and so no
race; consequently, the judge’s authority to declare the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>plaintiff winner did not arise. The other point decided in
this case as to recovering stakes has been noticed above.</p>

<p class='c007'>N.B.—This case by no means decides that an umpire
never has power to award the stakes to a person whose
horse has simply walked over the course.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Smith</i> v. <i>Sadler</i>, L.R., 4 Q.B., 214.</div>

<p class='c007'>A somewhat similar point occurred in <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Sadler</i>.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c015'><sup>[203]</sup></a>
The plaintiff and K deposited stakes with the defendant
to abide the event of a sculling race between themselves, “to
row according to the recognised rules of boat-racing.” The
decision of the referee to be final. It was proved in evidence
that according to custom in a sculler’s race between watermen
the men start themselves, but in the event of either or
both making a default in starting, the referee was entitled to
interfere. At the time appointed, a great difficulty took
place in the men starting themselves. K complained to the
referee, who told him to give notice to the plaintiff that if he
did not start K was to row over the course without him.
K rowed over without giving plaintiff such notice. The
referee, without further inquiry, ordered the stakes to
be paid to K, which the defendant did. Plaintiff sued
to recover his deposit, thus disputing the decision of the
referee. For the defendant (<i>i.e.</i>, practically in favour of the
referee’s decision) it was argued—(1) That the referee was
in the position of an arbitrator; that therefore not even
misconduct on his part could be pleaded in answer to an
action on the award; but the award must first be set aside;
(2) that the referee had virtually decided that there had
been a proper start and a proper race, and that according to
the authorities such decision was binding. The Court,
however, held (1) That the cases as to setting aside the award
did not apply because the jurisdiction of the referee had
never arisen. The order he had given to K was conditional
and K had not carried it out; therefore the race had never
been rowed and there was nothing for the referee to decide.
(2) That although <i><span lang="la">primâ facie</span></i> it would be implied from the
award of the stakes that there had been a proper start and a
race, that inference had been rebutted by the evidence given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>at the trial. Therefore the referee never had authority to
declare K the winner, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover
his stake from defendant.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c015'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Decision of stewards.</div>

<p class='c007'>Whenever it is made part of the conditions of a horse-race
that the decision of the stewards shall be final, it is not
competent for any party to question their decision, and it
seems that they are not in the same position as arbitrators.
They are not bound to hear the parties before deciding, they
need not give a joint decision, they are not disqualified by
having an interest in the race. Thus in the case of <i>Benbow</i>
v. <i>Jones</i><a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c015'><sup>[205]</sup></a> the plaintiff was the owner of the horse that came
in first, but the steward had previously decided, without
hearing him, that his horse was disqualified. The Court held
that these circumstances did not prevent the decision being
final. As <span class='sc'>Alderson, B.</span>, humorously expressed it, the next
contention would be that the steward was bound to hear
the parties on oath and counsel on both sides. In <i>Parr</i> v.
<i>Winteringham</i><a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c015'><sup>[206]</sup></a>, where the stewards gave separate decisions
without consultation, it was held that this was sufficient. In
<i>Ellis</i> v. <i>Hopper</i><a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c015'><sup>[207]</sup></a> a steward was held not to be disqualified by
his having made a bet on the race. In <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Overbury</i>,<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c015'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
where the stewards could not agree as to the winner, it
was held that the exclusive right of the stewards to decide
lasted until it had become impossible to obtain their
decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, in <i>Dines</i> v. <i>Wolfe</i>,<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c015'><sup>[209]</sup></a> the facts were as follows;
Agreement between plaintiff and A for a race between their
respective horses for £500 aside, weight for age, to be run
under Australian Jockey Club rules; £100 aside deposited
with defendant as stakeholder, balance to be paid to
defendant fourteen days before the race. According to the
rules of the Jockey Club, the stakes ought previously to the
race to have been paid over to the Treasurer of the Jockey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Club, but plaintiff insisted on their being retained by
defendant. A’s horse won; after the race, plaintiff, finding
that A’s horse had only been weighted as a four-year-old,
objected that he was a five-year-old. He wrote a letter
to this effect to the stewards, objecting to A’s horse being
declared winner. By the rules of the Jockey Club, when
the age or qualification of a horse was objected to, either
before or after the running, the stewards should call for
such evidence as they might require, and their decision was
to be final. The stewards met to consider their decision and
the plaintiff produced certificates as to the age of A’s horse;
after the meeting had been several times adjourned, the
plaintiff demanded another adjournment, which the stewards
refused. They finally decided in favour of A’s horse. The
defendant paid over the money to A. It does not appear
that the plaintiff had previously demanded his stakes back
from defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plaintiff sued defendant for the whole of the stakes as
winner of the race. He contended (1) that the rules of the
Jockey Club had not been complied with, inasmuch as the
stakes had not been deposited with the treasurer of the club;
therefore the race had never been run according to agreement;
(2) that the stewards had not fairly decided the case,
having refused his request for a further adjournment.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c015'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The jury awarded the plaintiff £500 (the amount of his
own stakes) on the ground that the rules of the Jockey
Club had not been complied with. The Supreme Court
granted a new trial, and from this plaintiff appealed to the
Privy Council. The judgment of the Privy Council was
delivered by Lord <span class='sc'>Chelmsford</span>. Plaintiff could not recover
the whole of the stakes without a decision of the stewards
that he was the winner. He could not recover even his own
stakes back unless he had repudiated the agreement before
the race was run (<i>i.e.</i>, run according to the agreement).
The plaintiff could not maintain his objection that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>agreement had not been complied with, as he himself had
consented to the money remaining in the stakeholder’s
hands instead of being paid over to the treasurer; further,
that plaintiff in writing to the stewards was really claiming
the benefit of the rules, and could not therefore be heard to
say that the race was not run under them. <i>Held</i>, also, that
the stewards had acted <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i>, and that according to the
rules there was no appeal from their decision.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Provisional decision.</div>

<p class='c007'>Again, in <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Littledale</i>,<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c015'><sup>[211]</sup></a> where objections were
taken to the winner on several grounds, the stewards in
the weighing room decided in his favour on one point,
subject to the other questions. Subsequently, the winner
was disqualified on grounds that were inconsistent with the
first decision. <i>Held</i>, that the first decision was provisional
only and therefore, <i><span lang="la">ultra vires</span></i>, that the final decision was
binding.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stewards’ decision on points of construction.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Newcomen</i> v. <i>Lynch</i><a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c015'><sup>[212]</sup></a> it was held, where the rules of a
race provide that the decision of the stewards should be
final, that applies to questions of construction of the rules
of the race, as well as to questions of fact.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Construction of agreement by the Court.</div>

<p class='c007'>But where the agreement does not contemplate any special
method of deciding disputes, the Court will construe it. If
necessary, parol evidence will be admitted to explain conventional
or sporting terms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parol evidence.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus, in <i>Hussey</i> v. <i>Crickett</i>,<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c015'><sup>[213]</sup></a> evidence was admitted to
explain the term “Rump and dozen.” In <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Pratt</i>,<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c015'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
it was explained that an agreement for a steeplechase “across
country” meant a course over all obstructions, and prohibited
going through open gates.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Daintree</i> v. <i>Hutchinson</i><a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c015'><sup>[215]</sup></a> there was an agreement
between plaintiff and defendant for a dog match to be run on
the Wednesday during the Newmarket February Meeting,
1841, P.P. Plaintiff was member of the Newmarket Club,
but defendant was not. By the rules of this club, the
February Meeting was fixed at the previous November
Meeting, for a certain date, weather permitting. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>day of the meeting there was a hard frost, and the club
adjourned to another day, weather permitting. The meeting
had again to be put off to a subsequent Tuesday. On the
Wednesday after that, the plaintiff appeared, ready to run
the race, but defendant did not turn up. Defendant contended
that the agreement meant the Wednesday in the
week originally fixed for the Newmarket Meeting. But the
Court held that the rules of the club were admissible to show
that the meeting was what Baron <span class='sc'>Parke</span> called a “moveable
feast,” and that the true construction was that the race should
come off on the Wednesday in any week in which the meeting
should actually take place. <i>Held</i>, also, that parol evidence
was admissible to explain that the letters P.P. meant that
the parties were either to run the match or forfeit the stakes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Play or pay.</div>

<p class='c007'>It may, perhaps, be mentioned here that the term “play
or pay” is well known and understood both in racing and
betting matters. In most races the conditions provide,
that if the owner of a horse nominated withdraws him
from the race he pays a smaller sum than the stake, usually
half the stake, by way of “forfeit.” In some cases,
however, he still remains liable for the whole stake and
then it is called a “play or pay” race. So in betting, to
say that a bet is “p.p.” means that if the horse backed
does not run the backer still has to pay.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c015'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gentleman rider.</div>

<p class='c007'>As to the construction of the term “gentleman rider,” see
<i>Walmsley</i> v. <i>Mathews</i> (3 M. &#38; G., 133).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rules of racing are evidence.</div>

<p class='c007'>In construing an agreement, the Court will look at the
Rules of Racing or other the conditions of the race,<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c015'><sup>[217]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Agreement
requires
stamp.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but it
seems that any sporting agreement should be stamped before
the Court can look at it.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c015'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Starter when requisite.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus in <i>Carr</i> v. <i>Martinson</i> (<i>sup.</i> p. 76) the Court held on
the construction of the agreement that the presence of a
starter was necessary before the race could properly be run
at all. By the Jockey Club Rules the horses must be started
by the official starter or his authorised substitute.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parties can waive conditions.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The parties can, of course, waive any of the conditions of
the race by mutual consent or acquiescence, as was done in
<i>Dines</i> v. <i>Woolf</i>;<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c015'><sup>[219]</sup></a> or any party can without the consent of
the others waive a condition which tells solely for his benefit.
In <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Sumner</i> (35 J.P. 761), the plaintiff sued the stakeholder
for the stakes. An objection had been lodged against
the plaintiff as winner on the ground of his being on the unpaid
forfeit list, but the objection was, according both to the
local rules and the Newmarket Rules, lodged too late. The
plaintiff appeared before the stewards and did not raise the
point as to time, and the objection was sustained. <i>Held</i>,
that he could not now set up the point, as he waived the
benefit of the rule, which under the circumstances told
solely in his favour. <i><span lang="la">Quis que renunciare potest</span></i>, &#38;c., &#38;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Qy. in case of a Plate or “added money.”</div>

<p class='c007'>At least this would appear to be the case so far as regards
the authority of the stakeholder to pay over mere stakes to
the winner; the waiver of the competitors who have subscribed
them would be sufficient. But in the case of a Plate, or where
there is “added money” (<i>ante</i> pp. 73 and 74) contributed by
an outsider, the consent of such person or persons would be
necessary before any of the conditions could be waived.
Compare with this suggestion Rule of Racing 143, which provides
that in a sweepstakes the competitors may waive a walk
over, but in a Plate the consent of the Stewards is necessary.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stewards’ liability.</div>

<p class='c007'>A steward, being an unpaid official, is not liable for negligence
in not appointing a judge,<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c015'><sup>[220]</sup></a> nor, <i>semble</i>, could he be
responsible for the default of the stakeholder unless he
knowingly appointed an unfit person.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Games and sports within the Act.</div>

<p class='c007'>III. What are “lawful games, sports, or pastimes or
exercises” within the Act?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horse-racing.</div>

<p class='c007'>The question can be best answered by showing what games
are unlawful either at Common Law or by statute. Some
have a history. Thus horse-racing was for a long time subjected
to considerable restriction. It will be remembered
that by the Statute of Anne, section 5, it was made penal to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>win any sum over £10 at any one time, by means of gaming.
It was always understood that horse-racing, which was expressly
mentioned in the Statute of Charles II., was a game
within the Statute of Anne, the games in both statutes being
the same.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c015'><sup>[221]</sup></a> The result was, as is shown in <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Pratt</i><a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c015'><sup>[222]</sup></a>,
that a horse-race for a prize of over £10 was held to be
illegal. Curiously enough, in <i>Applegarth</i> v. <i>Colley</i>, an entirely
different construction was put upon those statutes by the
Court of Exchequer; it being there held that the statutes
did not affect a case (1) where the stakes were deposited
with a stakeholder before the race was run, the statutes
aiming at gaming on credit and “contracts for the payment
of money won at gaming;” (2) where the stakes were made
up of subscriptions under the value of £10, the term winner
of £10 only contemplating a case where there was a corresponding
loser of that sum. However, by the time that this
case was decided, all restrictions on horse-racing had been
wiped off the statute books: so that this more lenient construction
of the earlier prohibitive statutes came rather late.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immediate result of the statutes was that a large
number of races were started for small prizes under £10, so
as not to infringe the Act, a practice which tended to deteriorate
rather than improve the breed of horses. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>13 Geo. II.,
c. 19.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To remedy
this the Statute 13 George II., c. 19, was passed, which
prohibited any horse-race being run except at Newmarket or
Blackhambleton in Yorkshire, for any prize of less value
than £50. It also prescribed some arbitrary regulations as
to the weights which horses of certain age should carry.
The object, of course, of this statute was to prevent horse-races
being run where the prize was not sufficiently remunerative
to encourage the improvement of the breed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>18 Geo. II.,
c. 34.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
Statute 18 George II., c. 34, repealed so much of the previous
statute as related to the carrying of weights, but the other
provisions of 13 George II., c. 19, which restricted the practice
of horse-racing, remained in force until the passing of
3 &#38; 4 Vict., c. 35. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>3 &#38; 4 Vict.,
c. 35.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By this statute all the enactments of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>13 George II., c. 19, relating to horse-racing, were repealed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Evans</i> v.
<i>Pratt</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In <i>Evans</i> v. <i>Pratt</i><a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c015'><sup>[223]</sup></a> a question was raised as to the exact
effect or result of this statute. The plaintiff sued to recover
the stakes of a steeplechase “across country,” of which he
had been declared winner. The main point was whether
such a steeplechase for a prize of more than £10 was within
the Statutes of Charles II. and Anne. It was argued on the
one hand, that by the repeal of the earlier Statute of
George II., without mentioning the statutes of Charles II.
and Anne, the law as it existed under the latter was
virtually restored, and, therefore, that a race for £10 was
illegal. On the other hand, it was contended that the
restrictions on horse-racing contained in the Statutes of
Charles II. and Anne were repealed by 13 George II.,
c. 19, which substituted other provisions; and that the
repeal of the latter statute had given “a new charter to
horse-racing.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>All horse-racing
made
legal.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Court held that the Statute 3 and 4
Vict., c. 35, had legalised all horse-racing, and that steeplechases
were included in that term.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>42 &#38; 43 Vict., c. 18. Horse races near London require a license.</div>

<p class='c007'>The only restriction in modern times to which horse-racing
has been subjected is in the case of races within ten
miles of London, the increase of which had been productive
of great inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>By 42 and 43 Vict., c. 18, it is provided—</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 1, a horse-race is in substance defined to be any
competition between horses, or any race against time for any
prize or any wager in respect of any such horse, at which
more than 20 persons shall be present.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 2 makes all horse-races within 10 miles from
Charing Cross unlawful unless licensed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sections 3 and 4 prescribe the method of obtaining such
license.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 5 inflicts a penalty of £10 or two months on any
person taking part in such unlicensed horse-race.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 6 inflicts a penalty of from £5 to £25 on owner
or occupier of ground where no such race takes place.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Section 7 makes any horse-race contrary to the Act a
common nuisance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cock-fighting seems to have been illegal at Common Law.
In “Bacon’s Abridgment” it is stated that an information
would lie at Common Law for using the game of cock-fighting.
In <i>Squiers</i> v. <i>Waiskin</i>, Lord <span class='sc'>Ellenborough</span> described it “a
barbarous diversion not to be encouraged in a Court of Justice.
I believe that cruelty to these animals in throwing at them
forms part of the dehortatory charge of judges to grand
juries.” It was forbidden in the metropolis by 2 &#38; 3 Vict.,
c. 47, section 47, under a penalty of £5, and by 12 &#38; 13
Vict., c. 92, the same penalty is inflicted for keeping or using
any “place” for the purpose of fighting or baiting any bull,
bear, badger, dog, cock, or other animal. But these Acts<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c015'><sup>[224]</sup></a>
only apply to a place kept for the purpose. A case was
lately noticed in the newspapers of a cock-fight having taken
place on board a ship out at sea, and the question was suggested
whether this could be a “place” within the Act. It
should be remembered that the Statute 4 George IV., c. 60,
defines the word “place” in previous statutes as including
places “on land or water.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Billiards</i> is a perfectly lawful game,<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c015'><sup>[225]</sup></a> except that the
keeping of public tables is subject to restrictions. By 8 &#38;
9 Vict., c. 109, sections 11 and 13, it is necessary for the
keeper of any public house, or any person setting up a public
table, to take out a license for the same. It is made penal
to allow playing on such table between the hours of 1 a.m.
and 8 p.m., or in the case of a licensed victualler’s, at any
time when his premises may not be open for the sale of
intoxicating liquors. However, a subsequent statute, 37 &#38;
38 Vic., c. 49, section 10, empowered licensed victuallers
to sell liquor at any time to persons residing on their premises,
but it has been held that that does not authorise the playing of
billiards except at the times mentioned in the previous statute;
it was, the Court said, a <i><span lang="la">casus omissus</span></i> in the statute.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c015'><sup>[226]</sup></a> So,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of course, games played on public tables at other than the
authorised hours are not within section 18 of 8 and 9 Vict.,
c. 109. This will be more fully discussed in the chapter on
gaming houses.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Lotteries</i> are illegal, as will be explained in a future part
of this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>By 12 George II., c. 28, section 2, <i>ace of hearts</i>, <i>pharaoh</i>,
<i>bassett</i> and <i>hazard</i>,<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c015'><sup>[227]</sup></a> are declared to be illegal games, to
which list 13 George II., c. 19, section 19, has added the
games of <i>passage</i> and any game with one or more dice or
instrument in the nature of dice with one or more figures or
numbers thereon, except <i>backgammon</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>18 George II., c. 34, provides that no person shall keep
any house or place for playing <i>roulet</i> or <i>roly-poly</i> or any
game with cards or dice prohibited by law.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>33 Henry VIII., c. 9.</div>

<p class='c007'>A number of games were made unlawful by a statute 33
Henry VIII., c. 9, on the ground that they diverted people’s
attention from the pursuit of archery. Among these were
<i>bowling</i>, <i>coyting</i>, <i>tennis</i>, when played by artificers and
apprentices; and all persons were bound, under penalty of
6s. 8d., to provide themselves with bow and arrow. But
these provisions of the statute were repealed by section 1,
8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Dominoes</i> has been held to be a lawful game.<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c015'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c013'>TRANSACTIONS ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It has been deemed advisable to treat of transactions on the
Stock Exchange under a separate heading: not that they are,
in the main, subject to different statutory provisions; but as
the facts in these cases are of a very special character, and to
a great extent stand on common ground, it will probably
facilitate reference if they are all grouped together instead of
being scattered over the rest of the work. This Chapter is not
intended to give an exposition of Stock Exchange transactions
generally, but only so far as it has been sought to apply
the gambling statutes thereto.<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c015'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that wagering transactions of this
description were not touched by the earlier statutes of Charles
II. and Anne, which applied solely to games and pastimes.
So that until the passing of the statute we are about to mention,
time-bargains, as they have been called, were not only
lawful but were enforceable by action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief statute on this subject was 7 George II., c. 8,
commonly called Barnard’s Act, which provided—“That <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>7 Geo. II., c. 8.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
all
contracts or agreements upon which any premium should be
paid for liberty to put upon, or to deliver, receive, accept,
or refuse any public or joint-stock or public securities whatsoever&#160;... and all wagers and contracts in the nature of
wagers, and all contracts in the nature of puts and refusals
relating to the then present or future value of any such stock
or securities as aforesaid, shall be null and void.” The statute
also inflicted penalties both for entering into such contracts
and for making payments in respect thereof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 8 made invalid all sales of stock not in the
vendor’s possession.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Statute only applied to public English stocks.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>The statute only applied to English public stocks, and not
to foreign stocks nor to shares in companies.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c015'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It also made the contracts and compounding for differences
not merely void but illegal. Thus in <i>Cannan</i> v. <i>Bryce</i><a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c015'><sup>[232]</sup></a> it
was held that money lent for the purpose of compounding
such differences could not be recovered. But in <i>Faikney</i> v.
<i>Reynous</i>,<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c015'><sup>[233]</sup></a> where a bond was given to repay money advanced
by plaintiff to settle for differences, it was held that the bond
was good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Nicholson</i> v. <i>Gooch</i>, 5 E. &#38; B., 999.</div>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Nicholson</i> v. <i>Gooch</i><a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c015'><sup>[234]</sup></a> was an important case
under this statute, and also seems to have some bearing on
Stock Exchange transactions at the present day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bankrupt Lodge was a member of the Stock Exchange
and the defendant was the official assignee of that body. By
the rules of the Stock Exchange every member unable to
fulfil his engagements was declared a defaulter, and all members
indebted to him in respect of Stock Exchange transactions
were to pay their debts to official assignees appointed by the
Stock Exchange, whose duty it was to distribute the money
received rateably among his Stock Exchange creditors. On
11th November, Lodge wrote to the secretary to say he
could not meet his engagements, and large sums were paid
to defendant by members who were his debtors. On 23rd
November a petition in bankruptcy was presented against
Lodge; on the 31st, Lodge was adjudicated bankrupt. The
plaintiffs were Lodge’s assignees in bankruptcy. It seemed
from the evidence that according to the customary way of
dealing, speculative transactions and genuine sales were so
mixed up, that it was impossible to separate the two; but the
jury found that the majority of the transactions were speculative
and the parties merely intended to settle differences.
It seemed that the method of settling these differences was
for the members on the account day to set off the amount of
stock which they had respectively agreed to buy and sell,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and by a fictitious bargain for the sale at the price of the day
of as much stock as would cover the balance, and then settle
by paying the difference in the price. The plaintiff sued
defendant for the moneys they had received from Lodge’s
debtors. The Court drew an inference of fact that they were
all contract for differences only. <i>Held</i>, that the settling of
differences without actual delivery of stock was, so far as the
public stock was concerned, illegal by section 5 of Barnard’s
Act. That money paid to defendant in pursuance of this
illegal arrangement, and forming the fund sought to be
recovered, could not be recovered, as it could not form part of
Lodge’s estate.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c015'><sup>[235]</sup></a> Therefore the assignees had no title to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been attempted on the plaintiff’s behalf to apply
the doctrine of <i>Tennant</i> v. <i>Elliott</i>, and so prevent the
defendant from setting up the illegality against them.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c015'><sup>[236]</sup></a> But
the Court held that this did not apply because defendant
received the money, not as agent for Lodge or for his use, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Position of
Official
Assignee of
Stock
Exchange.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but
on an implied mandate to distribute it according to the
rules of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Crampton, J.</span>, distinguished the receipt of money for
differences on public stock which was illegal, and on ordinary
shares which were not within the statute. In the latter case
the doctrine of <i>Tennant</i> v. <i>Elliott</i> might have applied if
defendant had received the money as Lodge’s agent, and
subject to his disposal. But the receipt seems to have been
under <i>an adverse claim</i> by virtue of the stock Exchange
rules rather than as agent of the bankrupt.</p>

At the same time it
seems still of importance as showing the position of
the official assignee of the Stock Exchange, <i>i.e.</i>, the
agent of the Stock Exchange, to distribute the money
according to their rules; the defaulter, as a member
of that body, binding himself to authorise the money in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>event of his default to be paid to the Stock Exchange or
their agent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ex parte Grant.</span></i> 15 Ch. D.</div>

<p class='c007'>A late case bearing on this topic, and to a great extent
confirming the views of <span class='sc'>Crampton, J.</span>, in <i>Nicholson</i> v.
<i>Gooch</i>, is that of <i><span lang="la">ex parte Grant re Plumbly</span></i>.<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c015'><sup>[237]</sup></a> Plumbly
declared himself a defaulter and on the same day presented
his petition in bankruptcy. By virtue of his being a
defaulter the official assignee, as stated above, became entitled
to receive money due to him for differences. An injunction
was obtained in bankruptcy against the official assignee
against receiving and collecting such debts, and an order to
pay all sums that he had received to the trustee in bankruptcy.
Against this order the official assignee appealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence chiefly consisted of affidavits filed by leading
members of the Stock Exchange. Some points in these
affidavits call for special notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) That contracts on the Stock Exchange are never for
payment of differences, but are real transactions for
cash&#160;... contemplating transfer or delivery of the
stocks, &#38;c. The transfer and payment can only be rendered
unnecessary by a new and equally real bargain, on the one
part to accept and pay for on the same day, and on the
other part to transfer or deliver, an equivalent amount of the
same stocks, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Members having bargains open in stocks and shares
which the defaulter has contracted either to take or deliver,
but which contracts he breaks by his default, pay to the
official assignee the difference in value of stocks, &#38;c., as
determined by the prices fixed by the official assignee, at the
time of such default, when the change in price is against
such members; and on the other hand become entitled to
claim against the fund so created in the hands of the official
assignee for any such differences when in their favour.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The defaulter cannot claim differences on damages in
respect of contracts which he has broken by his default, nor
can he claim the moneys payable as differences under the
rules to the official assignee.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>(4.) Had Plumbly not become a defaulter nor a
liquidating debtor, and had all the contracts been duly
performed by him, none of the differences received by the
official assignee would have found their way into Plumbly’s
possession. In payment of differences, bank notes and cash
do not pass and cannot be demanded. All payments on
account of differences must be by crossed cheques on a
clearing house banker, and the whole of the differences which
a member is entitled to pay or liable to receive on each
account day must all pass through the Clearing House
together. If the balance is in his favour, he receives only the
difference; otherwise, the general balance of all his dealings
goes to his debit through the operation of the bankers’
clearing. The credit differences of each member are thus
directly hypothecated for the payment of his debit differences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader is referred generally to the affidavits in the
case, which are set out <i><span lang="la">in extenso</span></i> in the report; but the
above will be sufficient to render the judgment intelligible.
<i>Held</i> (1) that the official assignee received the moneys by a title
adverse to the trustee, who on that account could not claim
them as received to his use. (2) The fund claimed was
an entirely artificial fund, created by the rules of the Stock
Exchange: if the contracts were winning ones, the trustee
could not have enforced them at law, as the defaulter had
shown his incapacity to perform the contracts himself: so
that the differences could never have been payable to the
trustee who was now claiming them. (3) That the trustee could
not take advantage of those rules, to which alone the fund
owed its existence, and claim the moneys, without also complying
with them with respect to the distribution; <i>i.e.</i>, he
could not claim for distribution among the general body of
creditors. <span class='sc'>James, L.J.</span>, put the case on a more general
ground. If A owes money which is claimed by B and C,
and he pays B, C cannot sue B; but payment does not
discharge A, if wrongful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case shortly seems to come to this:—“Differences” are
payable simply by the rules of the Stock Exchange, and not
as a matter of contract between two parties; being payable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to the official assignee by virtue of those rules, the fund
thereby created in his hands must be subject to the same
rules. That the official assignee receives these differences in
his own right and not to the use of the defaulter’s trustee in
bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems, then, that even if bargains for “differences” were
known on the Stock Exchange (which it appears they are
not), the rights of the official assignee with respect to them
as against the trustee in bankruptcy would be governed by
the above case, as he could only receive them under the
rules, and not as a legal debt. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Nicholson</i> v.
<i>Gooch</i> and
<i><span lang="la">ex parte Grant</span></i>
compared.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The two cases seem to a great
extent to stand on a common ground, though the former was
not cited in argument in the latter. In both it was held
that the title of the official assignee was adverse to that of
the trustee in bankruptcy, so that the former could in no
sense be considered his agent. In both the ratio of the
decision was that the fund was entirely artificial and owed
its existence to the Stock Exchange rules, as the moneys
which formed the funds were irrecoverable at law. They
were irrecoverable in <i>Nicholson</i> v. <i>Gooch</i> on the ground that
the payments were in pursuance of illegal or void contracts;
and in Plumbly’s case there was the additional reason pointed
out that as he by his default was incapable of performing his
part of the contract, he could not enforce it himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</div>

<p class='c007'>The next statutory provision concerning this class of
cases is contained in the statute we have discussed above,
declaring all wager-contracts to be void. The question of
the application of this statute to Stock Exchange transactions,
depends upon how far such transactions are in the
nature of wagers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Contracts for payment of differences.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Courts have more than once been called upon to adjudicate
upon what have been supposed to be contracts for the
payment of “differences,” that is the difference between the
present and the future price of stock. Contracts of this sort
have been called “time-bargains”; a phrase we shall avoid,
as it seems to be used in more senses than one. An instance
of such a contract, or rather of a contract which the jury
found to be of this nature, is to be found in <i>Grizewood</i> v.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><i>Blane</i>.<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c015'><sup>[238]</sup></a> It will be seen that the bargain as the jury found
the facts took the form of two collateral bargains, the result
of which was that differences only passed between the parties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Grizewood</i> v. <i>Blane</i>, 11 C. B., 526.</div>

<p class='c007'>The bargain was that plaintiff should purchase of defendant,
and defendant should sell to plaintiff a certain number of
shares in certain companies at a specified price. The said
shares rose in price. The parties then entered into a second
agreement to rescind the former one, and that defendant should
buy of plaintiff the same number of similar shares at such
increased prices, and that defendant should merely pay the
plaintiff the difference between the two prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Defendant pleaded generally that the contracts were void
under the statute, which plea was held bad, for not stating
the facts which brought the case within the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case went to trial on issues of facts raised in the
pleadings—that the contract was by way of wagering on the
price of the shares, and was merely colourable; that it never
was intended that the said shares should be bought and sold,
but was a mere wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plaintiff was a stock jobber; and the defendant had
dealt with plaintiff through his broker. Evidence was given
to show the former course of dealing between parties, that
no shares ever passed, but the parties merely settled differences.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Test of a gaming transaction.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Jervis, C.J.</span>, directed the jury that if at the time of
making the first contract the intention of the parties, as
understood by both of them, was neither to purchase nor
sell the shares, but only to settle differences, then the transaction
was void under the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court held that this ruling was right. The jury
found that it was a mere gambling transaction—<i>i.e.</i>,
that it was the intention of the parties at the time that
there should be no actual acceptance or delivery of the
shares.</p>

<p class='c007'>This finding of the jury upon the facts of this case have
been questioned in later cases, probably through the Courts
being in possession of more complete information as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>true nature of transactions on the Stock Exchange. Thus
<span class='sc'>Bramwell, L.J.</span>, in <i>Marten</i> v. <i>Gibbons</i>,<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c015'><sup>[239]</sup></a> and <span class='sc'>Brett, L.J.</span>, in
<i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>,<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c015'><sup>[240]</sup></a> both express their doubts as to the
correctness of the view the jury took of the facts. The case
had one peculiar feature, viz., that it was an action by a
jobber against the principal on transactions affected through
a broker, and as evidence was given of a long course of
dealing between the parties, there may have been special
circumstances in the case. It is remarkable that in <i>Cooper</i>
v. <i>Niel</i><a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c015'><sup>[241]</sup></a> the jury there found that the contract was simply
for the payment of differences; but again <span class='sc'>Brett, L.J.</span>, in
<i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>,<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c015'><sup>[242]</sup></a> says he could see no evidence of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the former case the broker became insolvent, and his
trustee sued the defendant for indemnity in respect of the
claims of the jobbers. But as the jury found that the
contracts were mere wagers, the jobbers could not claim in
respect thereof against the estate of the broker, and, being
insolvent, payment could not be enforced against him by the
rules of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Suggested test of a difference bargain.</div>

<p class='c007'>It seems that the test adopted in some of the cases, viz:—the
intention of the parties to deliver or not is unless properly
qualified and understood likely to be misleading. A sells to
B. A may be a “bear” or speculative seller of what he does
not possess; and B may be a “bull” or speculative buyer.
Both parties may hope or intend to secure a difference in
their favour, the one by re-purchasing, the other by a resale.
Each party may suppose that the other may be willing at
any time to close the bargain and settle by payment of
differences, yet the bargain as stated in this simple way is in
no sense a wager. The real test seems to be, what is the
primary bargain between the two parties, to ascertain whether
each of the parties could be called upon by the other in any
contingency, under the terms of the contract, to deliver, or
to take delivery and make payment. The subsequent
arrangements which the parties may make, <i>i.e.</i>, to close or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>settle by payment of differences even if carried out through
a long series of transactions and even though in contemplation
of the parties at the time of the contract, do not affect the
question if it was not part of the original agreement that
the bargain should be settled in this way, and if not
the contract could not be a wager. The expectation of the
parties might be upset by such a contingency as the winding
up of the Company; and it is the strict rights of the parties
to the bargain that must be regarded. This view of the
matter is confirmed by a passage in the judgment of
<span class='sc'>Lindley, L.J.</span>, in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>, 4 Q.B.D., at p. 689.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are called time bargains are in effect the result
of two distinct and perfectly legal bargains, viz: (1) a bargain
to buy or sell; (2) a subsequent bargain that the 1st shall not
be carried through, and it is only when the first is entered
into upon the understanding that it is not to be carried out,
that you get a time bargain in the sense of an unenforceable
bargain.” In a more recent case in the Court of Sessions,
Scotland, <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>The Caledonian Railway Company</i>, a passage
in Lord <span class='sc'>Shand’s</span><a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c015'><sup>[243]</sup></a> judgment requires attention. “If it appears
clearly that the contracts and the dealings between the parties
were for differences only and were not intended in any sense
to be real transactions, and were not in effect real transactions,
then they must be regarded as gambling transactions.
If it appears that any writings which passed between the
parties in the form of sale notes or otherwise were a mere
form intended by both parties, to give form to the transaction,
and to have no legal effect of any kind, then I do not
think that writings under such circumstances would take the
case out of the rule I have mentioned. But if contracts for
the sale of shares or goods are entered into <i>so as to create
mutual obligations upon the parties, on the one hand to give and
the other to take delivery, if the obligation is such as can be enforced
if either of the parties</i> think fit to do so, then I think we get
out of the region of arrangements of mere differences of the
nature of betting or gambling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If either one or both of the parties may, as and when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>thinks fit demand or give delivery of stock and ask payment
of the price under the contract, if that be so as to one of the
parties, then I think the transaction has the mark or stamp
of a real transaction and is inconsistent with the notion of
transaction for mere differences.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The passage in the judgment down to “betting or
gambling” seems entirely to confirm the view above
expressed, that a real transaction of purchase and sale must
create “mutual obligations” to deliver and accept. A can
call on B to complete and B can call on A. But the passage
which follows seems to contain a somewhat different
proposition: “If either one or both the parties may demand,”
etc. This would cover a case where A can demand delivery
from B, but B cannot from A. We shall have occasion again
to allude to this seeming discrepancy when we come to deal
with the case of <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Caledonian Railway</i> again.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the cases to which we are about to refer it
would appear that in point of fact transactions on the Stock
Exchange never do take the form of contracts for the mere
payment of differences. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Contracts for

<i>Thacker</i> v.
<i>Hardy</i>,
4 Q. B. D.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>,<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c015'><sup>[244]</sup></a> from a
remark in <span class='sc'>Lindley, J.’s</span> judgment at (p. 689), it seems to
have been stated by witnesses that time-bargains are
unknown on the Stock Exchange. The real nature of the
agreement in that case was found by <span class='sc'>Lindley, J.</span>, to have
been as follows:—(1) That defendant was a speculator and
employed plaintiff, a stock broker, to speculate for him on the
Stock Exchange. (2) Defendant knew that in order to do
so plaintiff would have to enter into contracts to buy or sell
stocks, &#38;c., and, to protect himself, to make other contracts
to sell or buy respectively. (3) Plaintiff knew, as was the
fact, that defendant never intended to accept or make actual
delivery of the stocks, &#38;c., bought or sold for him. (4) That
defendant took the risk of having to accept or deliver, &#38;c.,
hoping that plaintiff would be able so to arrange matters
that nothing but differences would be payable to or by
defendant. (5) That otherwise defendant would be unable
to pay for what was bought or deliver what was sold.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Plaintiff brought an action for indemnity for what he had
been called upon to pay in respect of these transactions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A case between broker and principal.</div>

<p class='c007'>This was a case it will be noticed turning on dealings
between a broker and a member of the outside public, and
so differed from <i>Grizewood</i> v. <i>Blane</i>. The judgment of
<span class='sc'>Lindley, J.</span>, decided the following points:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) That agreements between buyers and sellers of stock
to pay differences are gaming contracts within 8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109, s. 18.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That that section of the statute only affects the
contract which constitutes the wager. In this case plaintiff
was bound to enter into the contract himself as principal.
The contract between himself and the real principal was not
a wager-contract, but an implied contract of indemnity.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) That an agent is entitled to be indemnified against
all liabilities incurred on behalf of his principal, unless such
were illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) That the statute made gaming transactions void, and
not illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5.) It had been argued that such gambling transactions
were illegal at Common Law on the ground of public policy,
relying on Lord <span class='sc'>Tenterden’s</span> opinion in <i>Bryan</i> v. <i>Lewis</i>.
But this was overruled in <i>Hibblethwaite</i> v. <i>M‘Morrine</i>.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c015'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
Besides, it had required a special Act of Parliament to make
gambling in the funds illegal, and that Act was repealed
by 23 &#38; 24 Vict., c. 28.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6.) He did not infer as a fact that this contract was a
contract for differences. The real nature of the transaction
is stated above.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen, therefore, that the judgment treats of the
case from two points of view: first, granted the main contract
were in the nature of a wager. <i>Held</i>, in this case, that
according to previous authorities, the right of an agent to be
indemnified, was not affected. Second, that as a matter of
fact, there was no wagering in the transaction at all, so that
8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, did not affect the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case was taken up to the Court of Appeal, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>view taken by Lindley, J., as to the facts was confirmed;
consequently it became unnecessary to consider the application
of the statute to the case.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bramwell, L.J.</span>, said he would assume that the broker
might by the terms of the bargain be called upon to resell
the stock, so that the principal would only have had to pay
differences. That would not infringe the statute as a
gaming contract, for the principal might at any time elect
to take the stock and hold it as an investment&#160;... also the
broker might be unable to sell, if, for instance he had bought
shares in an insolvent bank. There is no wagering in a
transaction of that kind—the broker has no interest in the
stock—it does not matter to him whether the market rises
or falls; but when a transaction comes within the statute
against gambling and wagering, the result of it does affect
both parties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ex parte Rogers.</span></i></div>

<p class='c007'>In <i><span lang="la">ex parte Rogers</span></i><a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c015'><sup>[246]</sup></a> the facts seem to have been substantially
the same. A stockbroker named Evans issued a
debtor’s summons against Rogers in respect of money due
to Evans on the purchase and sale of stocks and shares on
Rogers’ behalf, and for commission, and for money paid by
Evans for carrying over<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c015'><sup>[247]</sup></a> a portion of the said stocks and
shares. The contracts were made by Evans, subject to the
rules of the Stock Exchange, according to which Evans had
to deal as principal between himself and the jobbers. It
was understood between Evans and Rogers that the latter
was only buying for the rise and never intended to accept
delivery, but meant to sell them again before the next
account day and receive or pay differences. Evans admitted
that sometimes in buying the same kind of stock for two
clients he bought the whole amount in one from the jobber,
and then resold to the clients, but he could not say whether
that had been done in respect of any transactions for Rogers.
There was also evidence to show that Rogers had met Evans
in his office, and authorised him to borrow money and pay
the jobbers. It was sought on behalf of the debtor to
distinguish the case from <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>, on the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>that the broker had acted as a principal and not as an agent,
having purchased for himself and resold to his clients, and
that the transaction being in the nature of a wager was
illegal (? void). But the Court held that there was sufficient
evidence that the broker had paid money at the debtor’s
request, therefore the case was within <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ex parte Grant</span></i>, 13 Ch. Div. Dealings between members of the House.</div>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i><span lang="la">ex parte Grant</span></i>,<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c015'><sup>[248]</sup></a> to which we have alluded
above, is important on the present subject, chiefly from the
evidence given in the case as to the course of dealing on the
Stock Exchange, which seems to confirm the finding of
<span class='sc'>Lindley, J.</span>, and the Court of Appeal, as to the facts of the
case in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>. At p. 671 it is stated: “Contracts
on the Stock Exchange are never for payment or
receipt of differences. All contracts, &#38;c., are real transactions
for cash or for a day named, contemplating the
actual transfer or delivery&#160;... and which transfer or
delivery can only be rendered unnecessary by a new and
equally real bargain on the one part to accept and pay for
on the same day, and on the other part to transfer or deliver
an equivalent amount of the same stock.” It is then
further stated that if a member having, say, bought stock
which he was unable or unwilling to take up, he balances
the transaction by selling a similar amount of (but not the
identical) stock for the same settling day for which the
bargain was originally made, so as to enable that particular
transaction to be written off and balanced. “The whole
amount of stock or shares to be taken and delivered
balances itself at all times, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Differences,
how adjusted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but the amount of stock to be
accepted from or delivered to the several persons with whom
any member has dealings, is liable to vary with every
new transaction entered into.” “When the settling day
arrives each member only transfers or delivers and accepts
and pays for the then balance of each particular description
of stocks or shares contracted for with each person with
whom he has dealt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The affidavits in this case should be carefully perused, as
they afford a great deal of information as to the method of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>doing business on the Stock Exchange. It seems clear that
the transactions there described can in no sense be in the
nature of wagers—they consist of an original purchase or
sale and a sub-sale or sub-purchase, the latter being probably
to a person who was not a party to the original
contract. Possibly if the sub-sale or sub-purchase were
made between the original parties and were contemporaneous
with the first contract, this might, according to the case of
<i>Grizewood</i> v. <i>Blane</i>, amount to a wager, but this method of
dealing seems to be unknown on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt the transactions which go on may be made a
means of reckless gambling; but it is necessary to bear in
mind <span class='sc'>Lindley, J.’s</span> warning in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i> against
being misled by an epithet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Qy. <i>Byers</i> v. <i>Beattie</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>There is, however, an Irish case,<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c015'><sup>[249]</sup></a> which certainly seems
open to question, in which the agreement was that the
plaintiffs, as stockbrokers, should buy and sell for the
defendant such stocks, &#38;c., as the defendant might require
on the terms that if a profit should result from the sale the
plaintiffs should account to the defendant for such profit,
deducting commission; if a loss, then the defendant was to
pay the amount of such loss to the plaintiff, plus commission.
<i>Held</i> that this was a wagering contract, as involving
an agreement for the payment in receipt of losses or
profits, and that the result would have been the same even if
the plaintiffs had shown themselves liable to third parties and
had sued on an implied contract of indemnity. The answer
to this decision seems to be that even if there were a wager
at all it was not a wager between plaintiffs and defendant.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems probable, therefore, in view of the facts laid
before the Court as to the customary course of dealing on
the Stock Exchange, and particularly having regard to
the decision in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>, that the statute will have
but little application to Stock Exchange transactions. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Effect of

Bargains
may no doubt in many cases be mere speculations on
the part of one party, but it is clearly stated by many
witnesses before the Stock Exchange Commissioners in 1878,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>that a man’s intentions as to holding or reselling his purchases
is not known to the other party, so that it cannot
be a wager as between the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>That this is the real state of the case is shown by the
evidence given by Mr. Pyemont before the Stock Exchange
Committee in 1878 (<i>see</i> p. 315). “With regard to
wagering and gaming, I may say that it was in consequence
of the remarks of the Lord Chief Justice which appeared in
the <cite>Times</cite> the other day, that I was led to tender my
evidence; I was sorry to see, in so high a quarter, such a
total misapprehension of the action of the Stock Exchange.
We have no such transaction on the Stock Exchange as
wagering and gaming. The only possible approach to anything
of the kind was dealing in dividends, which was
always reprobated by the Committee. The accounts were
never recognised if there were failures; and finding
that not recognising them did not stop the practice, the
Committee then made it penal to do so, but with that
exception I have never known such a thing as a wager.
Every £1,000 of stock which is sold on the Stock Exchange
must be delivered <i><span lang="la">per se</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">per alium</span></i>. It must be delivered
(whether demanded or not) and for this reason: If the
buyer does not pass me a name on the name day, I sell it
out through the secretary of the Stock Exchange for a name
to complete the bargain. There is no such thing as a bargain
left uncompleted. What I mean by <i><span lang="la">per se</span></i> or <i><span lang="la">per alium</span></i>
is that if I have sold £1,000 stock to B, if I am not prepared
to deliver it, I get D to deliver it to B on my
account, and pay him for doing so. If B does not want it,
he must find somebody who does. There is no such thing
as fiction in regard to any part of a Stock Exchange bargain.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Time-bargains.</div>

<p class='c007'>It does not seem that a Time-bargain in the proper sense
of the term, <i>i.e.</i>, a contract for the future delivery of something
the amount or value of which cannot be ascertained,
is in the nature of a wager. Thus, as put by <span class='sc'>Bramwell</span>
and <span class='sc'>Cotton, L.JJ.</span>,<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c015'><sup>[250]</sup></a> the sale of next year’s apple crop would
be a good contract.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>So when a person enters into a speculative sale of stock
on behalf of himself and another not having the stock in
possession, it was held in the Court of Session that it was not
a wagering transaction either as between the joint adventurers,
or as between the buyer and seller. <i>Mollison</i> v. <i>Noltie</i>.<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c015'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A contract for “differences” on the Stock Exchanges
though sometimes called a time bargain, is not such according
to <span class='sc'>Bramwell, L.J.</span>, in the ordinary sense of the word. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sale of
prospective
dividends.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So
in <i>Marten</i> v. <i>Gibbon</i><a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c015'><sup>[252]</sup></a> a question arose as to the validity of the
sale of a prospective dividend. Defendant employed
plaintiffs, who were stockbrokers, to sell for him the next
dividend on £50,000 of South Eastern Railway A Deferred
Stock, and plaintiffs sold it to a firm of dealers on the Stock
Exchange. The dividends declared were in excess of the
price at which the plaintiffs had sold them; so plaintiffs requested
defendant to authorise them to pay the difference to
the dealer. On defendant’s refusal plaintiffs paid the amount
and sued defendant for indemnity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appeared that by Rule 61 of the Stock Exchange, the
Committee did not recognise bargains in prospective
dividends. There was no evidence as to whether the defendant
was at the time of the contract in possession of the
£50,000 of Stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was argued for the defendant (1) That this was a
transaction within 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109. (2) That as this
was not a contract which the Stock Exchange would enforce,
no authority to pay the difference could be implied, and
there was no evidence of an express authority. (3) Defendant
had revoked the plaintiff’s authority to pay.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Court held (1) That it must be assumed, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary, that the defendant had
the £50,000 of Stock in his possession at the time of the
contract. Therefore, although an agreement of this kind
would have been within Barnard’s Act, it was not within
8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, any more (as was put by <span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span>)
than the purchase from a fisherman for the next haul of his
net at a fixed sum. Even if it were a wager as between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>principal and the broker, it could not be assumed that the
jobber knew that it was. (2) That the meaning of Rule
61 was, only that the Committee would not enforce such a
contract by expulsion, but the contract was otherwise left
good between the parties. The broker therefore, having at
defendant’s request entered into a contract on which he was
personally liable, the defendant could not revoke plaintiff’s
authority.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>New rule.</div>

<p class='c007'>Since this case was decided, the rule of the Stock Exchange
(No. 61) on this subject has been changed into one of a prohibitive
character, it being there provided “That no member
shall enter into bargains in prospective dividends in shares
or stock of railway or other companies.” So that while this
rule continues in force, no question is likely to arise as to
the rights or liabilities of members of the Stock Exchange
in bargains of this description.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sale of dividends of stock not in possession.</div>

<p class='c007'>The case, it will be seen, leaves quite unsettled what the
result of a bargain for the sale of dividends of Stock <i>not</i> in
vendor’s possession. It is submitted that the result of such
a bargain would be that the jury would, on the facts, find
that such were only in the nature of a wager, and that the
question would be left to them as one of fact.<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c015'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So much for differences on the Stock Exchange. It must
not, however, be assumed that transactions in stocks and
shares or indeed any kind of goods are never bargains for
differences only, and so equal to wagers. Those dealings in
outside Stock Exchange places, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bucket shops.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
commonly known as “bucket
shops,” sometimes take that form, see, for instance, <i>Reggio</i> v.
<i>Steven</i>,<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c015'><sup>[254]</sup></a> where the terms of defendant’s prospectus, on the footing
of which dealings had taken place, stipulated that all
bargains should be settled by payment of differences. These
bargains were held to be wager contracts. In <i>Shaw</i> v.
<i>Caledonian Railway Company</i><a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c015'><sup>[255]</sup></a> to which allusion has already
been made, the real issues in the action were between the
plaintiff Shaw and “R,” a customer. Plaintiff carried on
business as a stock and share dealer, not a member of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Stock Exchange. The terms on which the dealings were
conducted were as follows: the parties dealt as principals
not as principal and agent. “R” bought or sold of Shaw,
but in the main he bought. He deposited cover with Shaw
to the extent of 1 per cent. on the stocks he had opened.
If the price of the stock dealt in went against “R” to the
extent of 1 per cent., it was Shaw’s duty to close the transaction.
Prices were regulated by the tape. If “R” bought
of Shaw at 100 and the stock fell to 99 (middle figure) it
would be Shaw’s duty to close that stock by re-purchasing
from “R” at the lower price, so that “R’s” loss was to be
limited to the extent of 1 per cent., unless before the closing
“R” should deposit more cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears from the judgment of Lord <span class='sc'>Shand</span>, at p. 477,
though it does not appear from the report of the evidence
given in the case, that all these dealings were for the next
Stock Exchange account day, but that subject to Shaw’s
duty to close, “R” had the right of carrying over to the
subsequent account, (see <i>post</i> as to this transaction, p. 108)
but so long as the stock did not go against “R” to the
extent of the cover, “R” had the right of (1) keeping the
bargain open, of (2) closing by resale or repurchase from
Shaw, (3) calling on Shaw to deliver the stocks and paying for
them. On some occasions “R” was on the account day
credited with dividends on the stocks he had opened, and
with a premium on new stocks issued in right of old, also
on one occasion he was credited with a contango. (N.B.—This
must have been on a “bear” transaction, see <i>post</i> as
to this, p. 113.) All the transactions between the two were
completed by payment of differences, but it was otherwise
with some of the customers of Shaw. It appears that if
“R” sold, Shaw had a right to call for delivery (see the
evidence of Willis and Lord <span class='sc'>Shand’s</span> judgment, at p. 477),<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c015'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
but this seems to be the only option that Shaw had, and the
transactions out of which these proceedings arose were nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>all purchases by “R.” The Court held that these were real
transactions of purchase and sale, and not difference bargains.
(1) The crediting him with the dividends, &#38;c. showed him
to be absolutely the owner of the stocks, (2) because
“R” could at any time have gone and demanded delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, submitted that this decision is untenable.
In the first place “R” had an option in all cases where he
purchased of either completing by taking delivery or of
settling by the payment of differences; Shaw being the
seller, was not by the contract entitled to call on “R” to
take delivery and pay. It seems that when “R” elected
(as he was entitled to do by the contract) to treat it as a
difference bargain, the exercising of this option related back
to the time of the contract and gave the transaction the
character of a difference bargain from the first. The facts
do not fulfil the requirements suggested by Lord <span class='sc'>Shand</span>
for making a real bargain, the “mutual obligations” to
take and deliver, see <i>ante</i> p. 95, seeing that Shaw had no
option in the matter at all events until the cover was run
off, and then the contract was that the settlement was to take
place by payment of differences. The fact of the dividends,
the premium, and the contango, being credited to “R”
seems to give very little weight one way or the other, and
are quite consistent with a special arrangement in connection
with a difference bargain. See per <span class='sc'>Turner, L.J.</span>,
in <i><span lang="la">ex parte Marnham</span></i>.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c015'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It has above, at p. 96, been suggested that the judgment
of Lord <span class='sc'>Shand</span> seems to contain two conflicting tests of a
“real bargain;” on the one hand he suggests “mutual
obligations,” on the other, it is said to be sufficient if <i>either</i>
party can compel completion. No doubt “R” had the right
of calling for completion, and had he done so then the transaction
would have been a genuine purchase. But where one
of the parties has the option of electing which form the bargain
shall ultimately take, purchase or difference bargain, it is
submitted that the legal attributes of the transaction must be
determined by the form which it ultimately assumes in fact.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>A later Scotch case, <i>The Liquidator of the Universal Stock
Exchange</i> v. <i>Howat</i>, is open to the same criticism. The
terms on which the plaintiff company dealt with the defendant
were of a somewhat similar character to those proved
in <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>The Caledonian Railway</i>. The conditions endorsed
in the bought and sold note stated that the Company acted
as principal in all sales and purchases and not as broker,
being in all cases prepared to deliver or take up. Clients
might, if it suited their convenience, repurchase or resell
from or to the Company any stocks which they might have
sold or bought to or from the Company, but the Company
could not compel them to do so. Some of the defendant’s
instructions to the Company to sell to him contained
instructions to repurchase from him (or <i>close</i>) at a certain
profit. The action was brought to recover differences on
stocks which defendant had purchased and which had been
closed by plaintiffs on defendant’s instructions. The Court
held that these were real transactions of purchase and sale.</p>

<p class='c007'>Per the Lord President, at p. 135: “It is much more
likely that the arrangement was, that the transactions should
be as was expressed in the writings, that the legal rights of
both parties should stand as so expressed; but that the
attention of both parties should be directed towards escaping
from the unpleasant consequences&#160;... if contrary
to the interests of both, delivery were demanded and given.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, submitted that the effect of the conditions
quoted above, gave the customer an absolute right or option
to close his stocks and pay or receive differences; and that
when he exercised this option it gave the transaction the
character of a difference bargain. These being the rights of
the defendant, it is difficult to see how the rights of the
Company were in respect of real transactions.<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c015'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is another kind of transaction on the Stock Exchange,
as to which there may some day be a question how
far it is a gaming contract within the statute. These are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>called “Options.” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Options.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Options are described by a witness giving
evidence before the Stock Exchange Commission of 1878,<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c015'><sup>[259]</sup></a>
as the purchase of the right to buy or sell particular stock
on a particular day at a fixed price, <i>e.g.</i>, the price of Russian
Stock is 83 to-day, and a person wishes to acquire the right
to buy that stock on some future day, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Calls.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
believing that the price
will then be higher, and is desirous of not risking more than
a certain sum of money in a transaction, say 2 per cent.
He would probably be obliged to give 85 for the stock for
the end of March, upon the condition, that if he did not wish
to take up the stock, he must pay 2 per cent., the difference
between the day’s price and the price at which he bought:
that is in effect paying 2 per cent. for the right of saying at
the end of March whether he will or will not buy the stock
at 83. If he does not buy he loses 2 per cent., and the
stock must rise 3 per cent. by the time before he can make
1 per cent. profit. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Puts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then there is the converse case of a put,
which is payment of a premium for the right to sell, or call
upon a man to take delivery of, so much stock at a fixed
price. This is akin to a Bear transaction, and of course the
option will only be exercised in the event of a fall in the
price. The person who would accept this obligation would
be an intending purchaser, who is willing to give a price
equal to the price of the day, minus the premium. Suppose
the price of stock be at 90, A is desirous of purchasing, but
does not wish to give more than 88. B, believing they are
about to fall, wishes to “bear” them without incurring the
risk of heavy loss. So B gives A 2 per cent. for the right
on a future day of calling on A to take delivery of so much,
at the price of the day—90. If they fall to 87, B will
exercise the option and make 1 per cent. profit, while A has
got the stock virtually for 88, which he was willing to give.
If B does not exercise the option, A secures his 2 per cent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Double options.</div>

<p class='c007'>There are also double options, which give the right of
either buying or selling at a fixed time, that is to call it if it
goes up, to put it if it goes down, for which a double premium
is charged.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Are options in the nature of wagers.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>It has been suggested that these transactions would be
held void at law, as being in the nature of wagers. It was
remarked by the Chairman of the Stock Exchange Commission,
that they were very much in the nature of a “bet.”<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c015'><sup>[260]</sup></a>
It will be remembered, moreover, that Barnard’s Act places
all agreements for “puts and refusals” in the same category
as wager-contracts, which are all made illegal thereby. It
is, however, submitted that in all bargains for opinions the
great element of a wager is wanting. It does not seem to be
the essence of the bargain, to use the words of <span class='sc'>Cotton, L.J.</span>,
in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i>, “that one party should win and the
other should lose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose A gives B £2 for the option to buy of him so
much stock at a future date, at, say £80, the market price
of the day. The result to be must be the same in all cases.
He secures his £2. So far as this transaction goes, it is
immaterial to him whether the stock rises or falls in price;
he will in neither case be a loser as between himself and A.
Of course if the price rises 3 per cent., in which event A will
exercise the option, B may be called a loser in the sense that
he might have sold his stock at the increased price instead of
the price stipulated for, or that he may have to give increased
price for it in the market; but this seems to be only an indirect
loss, not a loss on the actual agreement with A. He is
in no event called on to make a payment to A. He is only
a loser in the sense as suggested by <span class='sc'>Cotton, L.J.</span>, in <i>Thacker</i>
v. <i>Hardy</i>,<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c015'><sup>[261]</sup></a> that any party to an ordinary contract of sale
may be so described according as the bargain turns out in
his favour or the reverse. No doubt, as stated by the witnesses
before the Stock Exchange Commission, in many cases
these options are purchased without the slightest intention
on the purchaser’s part of holding the stock; but still, as in
the case of an ordinary sale of stock, it is impossible for the
vendor to know what the purchaser’s ultimate intentions are,
which, according to cases cited above, takes the case out of
the category of a wager.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Continuations.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>There is a class of transaction very common upon the
Stock Exchange called in general “Continuations,” which, it
seems, may be made a mere cover for wagering. But here
the operation of the buyer and the seller must again be
distinguished. Suppose a buyer has purchased, for the next
account day, more stock than he can take up, he has to
arrange for the bargain being continued or carried over to
the next account day. If he be an outsider and not a member
of the Stock Exchange, he must of course get it arranged
through his broker. Application is then made to a dealer
who has money to lend, and perhaps, wants the stock. This
dealer may be the same person as the original vendor, or he
may not. In either case, the form of the transaction is a
purchase of the stock (in the former case it will of course be
a repurchase by the dealer); the price of this purchase or
repurchase is fixed by the clerk of the house, by the instructions
of the committee, as the price at which the continuation
is to be effected, and is called “the making-up price.” The
stock is then, by a collateral agreement, repurchased from
the dealer at the same price, only with an addition as premium
for the accommodation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Contango.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This premium is called a
“Contango;” and in cases where the bargain is arranged with
the original vendor of the stock, it is simply the consideration
for the vendor’s agreeing to postpone delivery of the stock
until the next account day; but where it is done with
another dealer, it is in substance an advance of money on
the security of the stock, and is called “taking in” by way
of continuation. It may be, however, that this “bull” or
speculative purchaser, may be in a position to demand a
“backwardation” (see <i>post</i>) instead of having to pay a
“contango,” that is, if the market is largely oversold and
the demand for the particular stock is greater than the
demand for money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the price has fallen so that the making-up price is
less than the original price, the purchaser in effect pays the
difference. Suppose A has bought £1,000 Railway Stock at
par for the current account, when the settling day arrives he
does not want to take it; he then agrees with his vendor to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>carry it over to the next account. Say the price has fallen
to 98, and that is the making-up price. The jobber
repurchases of him at 98 for the current account, thus leaving
a difference of 2 per cent. payable by the original purchaser
to the vendor, and this difference is payable on the current
account day. By a collateral agreement, the jobber resells
to him for the ensuing account at 98, plus the contango; so
that in the result he pays the original price, viz., par, plus
the contango as the price of the continuation. It comes to
the same thing if the purchaser gets another jobber to “take
in” the stock for him. He pays £100 to his vendor,
receiving £98, the “making-up price,” from the other jobber,
which is in effect an immediate payment out of his pocket of
2 per cent. If, on the other hand, the price has risen 2
per cent., so that the making-up price is £102, he would
receive £2 from his Vendor on the current account day, but
on the ensuing account he would have to pay £102, the
making-up price, plus contango. Sometimes these continuations
are effected over several accounts, the purchaser paying
or receiving differences according as the price falls or rises.
Such a transaction seems something like a loan of money on
the security of stock, the amount of the loan being by the
payment of the differences from time to time kept just equal
to the market price of the security.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Taking in” distinguished from loans.</div>

<p class='c007'>The “taking in” of stock by way of continuation must be
distinguished from a mere loan or deposit of stock. In the
former case it is, <i><span lang="la">pro tempore</span></i>, an absolute sale of the stock to
the jobber—the property passes to him—he can deal with it
as his own. He is, no doubt, obliged to deliver the same
amount of stock on the ensuing account day, but not the
identical stock. But in the case of a loan, he is not allowed to
sell it or place it beyond his own control, but may be called
upon to restore the identical securities. (See Rule 70.)<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c015'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that continuations are effected in the case of
loans where the stock is merely lent or deposited as security,
and not “taken in,” as in the transaction described above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>in which case, as has just been said, the stock is merely
pledged, and the lender cannot part with the control of it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>? Whether
continuations
ever in nature
of a wager.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It would, of course, be quite possible that parties might
enter into gaming transactions, or bargains for the payment
of differences, under guise of an agreement for the continuation
of a loan, the parties on either side paying or receiving
a difference according to the rise or fall in price, as before
described. The following cases will show by what test real
and fictitious bargains are to be distinguished.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Case of loan fluctuating according to value of security.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i><span lang="la">ex parte Phillips</span></i>,<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c015'><sup>[263]</sup></a> it appeared that it was an ordinary
dealing for one member of the Stock Exchange to make
advances of money on the security of shares, &#38;c., belonging
to the borrower, or on the deposit of certificates or other
evidence of title, and that such deposits often amounted to
the full value of the security; and that the lender was entitled,
if the advance were not repaid on the day agreed upon,
either to dispose of such security, or to retain it at the market
price of the day, and either to claim the deficiency or repay the
surplus. If the borrower were declared a defaulter and the
securities were not realised within three days of such
declaration, the lender must take them at a price to be
named by the official assignee. In November, 1858, Phillips
lent the bankrupt £775 at 6 per cent., on deposit of some
securities, till the next settling day. The loan was renewed
on several successive settling days upon the same terms,
except that when the value of the securities fell part of the
loan was paid off: but as the value rose the lender made
further advances, thus equalising from time to time the
amount of the loan and the value of the security. On 30th
April, 1859, a sum of £625 was in this way due to Phillips,
but the bankrupt had two days previously been declared a
defaulter, and the petitioner had retained the shares at the
market price of the day, they having fallen in value.
According to the custom of the Stock Exchange, it was optional
on each settling day for either party to renew the loan, the
amount being increased or diminished according to the then
value of the security. In July the debtor was adjudicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>bankrupt, and the petitioner tendered a proof for the amount
due, as above. The commissioner rejected the proof, on
the ground that the debt was due on a gambling transaction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Difference between real and fictitious loan.</div>

<p class='c007'>On appeal, this decision was reversed. <span class='sc'>Turner, L.J.</span>,
pointed out that it was not as though there was no real
advance of money, and a payment by one side or the other
according to the rise or fall of the stocks. Here there was a
<i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> advance, and the creditor was, in any event, to
receive the amount with interest, no more and no less.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i><span lang="la">Ex parte Marnham.</span></i></div>

<p class='c007'>So in the contemporaneous case of <i><span lang="la">ex parte Marnham</span></i>,<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c015'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
there was an alleged sale of shares to the bankrupt at a
certain price. The differences were paid on each settling day
by the bankrupt to the petitioner, and by the petitioner to
the bankrupt, as in Phillips’ case, and the account was finally
settled by the petitioner taking the shares at their value,
leaving a balance in favour of the petitioner, for which he
claimed to prove. There was no real delivery of the shares.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Turner, L.J.</span>, said that if the case had rested there, it
would have been necessary to have the case further investigated
before a jury; but it appeared that the dividends on
the shares were accounted for to the bankrupt, and, further,
the petitioner repurchased some of the shares from the
bankrupt and accounted to him for the value. The former
fact, perhaps, would not have been inconsistent with a mere
cover for the payment of differences; but the repurchase of
the shares and payment for them, stamped the transaction
with the character of reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are the criteria for testing the legality of such transactions;
as cases have been before the Courts it is necessary
to mention them. At the same time, we must not forget the
positive statement of the witnesses before the Stock Exchange
Commissioners, that, in point of actual practice, there is no such
thing as wagering or fiction in dealings on the Stock Exchange.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c015'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The seller.</div>

<p class='c007'>But, now, to take the converse case of the seller, who has
sold more stock than he can deliver. He has to apply to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>dealer who will advance him the stock. The operation here
effected is, the purchase of the stock for the current account
at the “making-up price,” and its resale for the ensuing
account. This resale may be at a lower price than the purchase,
and the difference between the two prices being the
premium paid to the dealer for the loan of the stock. It
may, on the other hand, be effected at the same price, if the
state of the market is such that the payment of the money
is of itself an accommodation to the dealer sufficient to induce
him to make arrangements, or if there is a large “bull”
account open, he may be entitled to receive a “contango.”
The premium, if any, received by the lender of the stock is
called a “Backwardation.” But, as explained by a witness
before the Stock Exchange Commissioners,<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c015'><sup>[266]</sup></a> the payment of
contango or backwardation depends upon whether the particular
stock is overbought or oversold. If an enormous
amount of stock is thrown upon the market more than it can
take, there is a heavy contango; if, on the contrary, an
enormous amount of stock is taken off the market, there is no
contango, but a backwardation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is submitted that the following conclusions result from
the foregoing cases:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Results of the foregoing cases.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Bargains for mere differences are wagers within
8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, though contracts on the Stock Exchange
never take that form.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That mere bargains for the future delivery of things
not in possession and the value of which is uncertain at the
time of the contract are not wagers.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) That in determining whether a bargain be in the
nature of a wager or not the substance of the agreement as
understood by both parties at the time must be looked at.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) That the question as to what were the real elements
of the agreement is a question of fact for the jury, but that
it is for the Court to decide on the nature of the agreement
on the facts so found. Both these positions seem clear from
the case of <i>Grizewood</i> v. <i>Blane</i> and the remarks of <span class='sc'>Turner,
L.J.</span>, in <i><span lang="la">ex parte Marnham</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>(5.) That the absence, in fact, of a material element of the
professed transaction is material as showing that the bargain
was a mere cover for a wager, <i>e.g.</i>, non-delivery of stocks or
shares, as in <i>Grizewood</i> v. <i><span lang="la">Blane ex parte Marnham</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6.) That, as between the jobber and the broker’s principal,
it is quite immaterial that the arrangement between
broker and principal is for a wagering contract, unless the
jobber is aware of it and so knowingly engages in a wagering
transaction. This clearly appears from the remarks of
the judges in <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i><a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c015'><sup>[267]</sup></a> and <i>Marten</i> v. <i>Gibbons</i>.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c015'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(7.) That where as between principal and jobber the contract
be a wager, the contract between principal and broker
to carry out the main contract is not one of wagering, but
gives rise to an implied contract right of indemnity. This
appears from <i>Thacker</i> v. <i>Hardy</i> and <i><span lang="la">ex parte Godefroi</span></i>.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c015'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is only necessary to mention very shortly a subsequent
statutory provision with respect to gaming and wagering
contracts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>12 &#38; 13 Vict.</div>

<p class='c007'>By the Bankruptcy Act of 1849, section 201, it is enacted
that no bankrupt should be entitled to his certificate of discharge
who should have lost by any sort of gaming or
wagering £20 in one day or £200 within twelve months
previously; nor who should have lost within the preceding
twelve months £200 by the purchase or sale of any stock
where such stock should not be actually transferred or
delivered in pursuance of the contract, or where the stock was
not to be transferred within one week after the contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that this enactment attaches penal
consequences to two classes of transaction: wagering contracts
and “speculations” on the Stock Exchange, using
the term in its wider sense, and not merely as equivalent to
bargains for differences. The principal points decided on
this section were:<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c015'><sup>[270]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) That speculations on the Stock Exchange (to which
the phrase “time-bargains” was more than once applied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the judges) were not wagers within the first part of the
section, as they were expressly dealt with in the latter part.
It seems, however, to have been admitted that they were or
might be wagers within 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That stock (and? shares) in railway companies was
within the Act, which did not, like Barnard’s Act, apply
only to public stock. In <i><span lang="la">ex parte Wade</span></i> a question was
raised as to whether Turkish scrip were within the Act, but
the point was not decided. However, it appeared from the
evidence of a stockbroker that scrip was not considered as
equivalent to stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) It would seem from the above cases that where the
purchase was for an account day more than a week distant,
or where delivery was postponed on a “continuation,” this
would bring the bankrupt within the Act.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c015'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) The practice of the Court was, where any question of
doubt arose, not to decide it, but to grant the certificate subject
to its being avoided for the reasons given in the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>These provisions with respect to the discharge of bankrupts
have not been repeated in subsequent Bankruptcy Acts;
though under the new Act it is still discretionary with the
Court whether the bankrupt shall have his discharge, regard
being had to his conduct in all cases of rash speculation.<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c015'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem, from the foregoing history of the legislation
in respect of betting contracts, that the tendency
of the Legislature has been to abstain from active interference
with the subject’s liberty, and to give negative discouragement
to the practice, by observing a neutral attitude
as between the parties, rather than to endeavour to stamp it
out by penal enactments. Thus within the last half century
three penal statutes on the subject have been repealed. The
Act of 1845 repealed the penal provisions of the Statute of
Anne. The penal provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of
1849 have not been renewed. Barnard’s Act, which it
seems, had for a long time been a dead letter, was repealed in
1860. There is, however, one statute in a contrary direction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>30 &#38; 31 Vict., c. 29, known as Leeman’s Act, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Leeman’s
Act, 30 &#38; 31
Vict., c. 29.
History of
legislation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which
enacts that all contracts for the sale or transfer of any
shares, stock or joint interest in any joint stock banking
company in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland constituted or regulated by the provisions of any
Act of Parliament, Royal Charter or letters patent, issuing
shares or stock transferable by any deed or written instrument,
shall be null and void to all intents and purposes
whatsoever unless such contract, &#38;c., shall set forth and
designate in writing such shares, stock or interest by the
respective numbers by which they are distinguished at the
making of such contract, &#38;c., on the register or books of such
banking company as aforesaid, or, where there is no such
register of stock, by distinguishing numbers, then unless such
contract, &#38;c., shall set forth the person or persons in whose
name or names such shares, stock or interest shall at the
time of such contract stand as the registered proprietor in
the books of such banking company. It is further made a
misdemeanour to insert in any contract a false entry of any
such number or names.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Effect of Leeman’s Act.</div>

<p class='c007'>The purport and effect of this statute is obvious; it is intended
to prevent speculative sales and purchases of bank
shares, and to annul such transactions in cases where the
vendor has not the shares in his possession at the time of the
contract: in the same way as Barnard’s Act prohibited the
sale of public stocks not in the possession of the vendor.
Leeman’s Act, however, only makes the contract void,
whereas Barnard’s Act made it illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circumstances which gave rise to the passing of the
Act are well known. From 1864 to 1866 there was a large
amount of speculation in bank shares, which caused great
fluctuation in their prices, and led to serious consequences.
From the evidence given by some of the witnesses before the
Stock Exchange Committee of 1878, it would seem that the
real origin of the panic is to be looked for, not in the “bear”
or selling movement, but in the previous rush to buy, which
was in some cases started by combinations of persons who
were supplied with means by the directors of the banks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>This “bull” movement produced the desired result of raising
the prices of the shares above their real value. The shares
then having reached a price which neither the dividends nor
the internal condition of the banks justified, speculators took
the opposite course; the “bear” operations which followed
caused a rapid fall in prices. Not only shareholders, but
depositors became alarmed, the sudden rush to withdraw
deposits was more than some banks could meet; but those
that did stop payment had long been hastening their own
ruin by unsound internal management and investment in
rotten securities. Others, whose condition was more stable,
suffered a temporary depreciation in the value of their shares,
but ultimately survived the panic. There were many reasons
why banks and bank shares should be protected in future
from such onslaughts and the disastrous results consequent
thereon, so Leeman’s Act was passed avoiding all contracts
for the sale of shares which at the time of the contract
could not be specifically identified: contracts which the
vendor could only perform by going and purchasing in the
market himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Act not observed on the Stock Exchange.</div>

<p class='c007'>In practice, however, the Act has on the Stock Exchange
been a dead letter, owing to the impossibility of transacting
business in the ordinary way if its provisions were observed.
But a recent case shows that although as between
members of the Stock Exchange it may be the practice to
disregard the Act, yet such practice does not bind the outside
public, and that if a broker, through not complying with the
Act, fails to carry out his client’s instructions, he may become
liable in damages.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Liability of broker.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Neilson</i> v. <i>James</i><a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c015'><sup>[273]</sup></a> the plaintiff employed the defendant
to sell for him some shares in the West of England Bank in
the Bristol Stock Exchange. The shares were not numbered,
but registered in the name of their owner. Defendant sold
them on the 4th of December to a firm of jobbers on the
Bristol Stock Exchange, but the bought and sold notes which
passed between the defendant and the jobbers on that date
did not disclose the name of the owner of the shares. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>13th December was the “name day” (<i>i.e.</i> the day on which
the jobbers were bound either to accept delivery of the shares
themselves or furnish the name of a sub-purchaser to stand in
their place,<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c015'><sup>[274]</sup></a>) and the jobbers then furnished the name of one
J. R. Gould as the purchaser to take delivery, who thereupon
became liable (under ordinary circumstances) to accept
and pay for the shares. But previously to this date, on the
7th of December, the bank had stopped payment and soon
after was wound up, and Gould repudiated his purchase on
the ground that the name of the owner of the shares did not
appear on the Contract, which was therefore void under
Leeman’s Act. The consequence was that the plaintiff
remained owner of the shares and lost the price he would
have obtained if the sale had been validly carried out.
Plaintiff sued to recover the price of the shares as stated in
the sold note.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the defendant it was argued—(1) That the agreement
of the 4th December was only inchoate and not the completed
contract, consequently there was no breach of duty on the
defendant’s part on that day. (2) That the real contract
was not completed till the 13th, and then performance was
impossible as the bank had then stopped payment and was
in the course of winding up; at any rate the damages should
be only nominal according to the value of the shares on the
13th. (3) That the defendant was employed by the plaintiff
to effect the sale subject to the customs of the Bristol Stock
Exchange; that one of those customs was to disregard the
provisions of Leeman’s Act in the sale of bank shares.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court decided—(1) That according to <i>Coles</i> v. <i>Bristowe</i><a href='#f274' class='c015'><sup>[274]</sup></a>
the contract was complete on the 4th, subject only to the right
of the jobbers to furnish the name of a sub-purchaser as a
substitute for themselves on the “name day.” (2) There is
no undertaking on the part of the vendor of shares that the
company shall be a going concern on the day of transfer;
consequently, as plaintiff would have been entitled to the full
price, that price must be the measure of damages. “It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>said,” remarked <span class='sc'>Brett, L. J.</span>, “on the part of the defendant,
that the plaintiff can only recover nominal damages, because
if the contract had been in due form, the jobbers would not
have been bound to have taken the shares, as the plaintiff
could not on the account day, when the bank was being
wound up, have given a valid transfer which the bank could
have registered. But it seems to me that all the seller was
required to do was to deliver shares on the account day,
which, if the bank had remained solvent would have entitled
the purchaser to have had them transferred into his name,
and that the seller does not undertake that banking company
shall be a going concern up to the account day. The
plaintiff was therefore ready to do all that he was bound
to do, and if the jobbers had accepted the shares on that day,
they would have been bound to have paid the agreed
price; and as the defendant failed to do that which would
have compelled them to have taken the shares, the plaintiff
lost such price by reason of such failure.” (3) That the
custom was bad as being unreasonable and illegal. Per
<span class='sc'>Brett, L. J.</span>: “He does not say the plaintiff knew of the
custom, but he says that because plaintiff employed him to
sell the shares on that Stock Exchange and according to its
rules, he is bound by that custom. I think, however, that
the plaintiff is only bound by such a custom as is both
reasonable and legal, for to that extent only can a person who
is ignorant of a custom be assumed to acquiesce in and be
bound by it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>N.B.—These remarks seem to assume that if plaintiff had
known and acquiesced in the custom he could not have been
heard to say the custom was unreasonable. This would
probably have been the case if the defendant had previously
done similar transactions for plaintiff without his taking
any objection.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the broker was held liable to his client for negligence, in
not conforming to the requirements of the statute, and thereby
depriving his client of the benefit of the sale of his shares.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen that the law as it stands is somewhat
in favour of an unscrupulous purchaser. The Act having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>made the contracts void, and not illegal or punishable, there
is nothing to prevent members of the Stock Exchange from
disregarding it, except a possible liability to a client; while
on the other hand, the inconvenience entailed by complying
with the Act is sufficient to induce dealers and brokers to
incur whatever risk there may be, so as to facilitate business.
It is probably only a member of the outside public that
would over take advantage of the Act, and repudiate a bargain
on the ground of non-compliance with it provisions.
Besides, there can be no doubt it affords a safeguard to banks
against undue fluctuation in the price of their shares.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a late case before the Court of Appeal, it seems
that in the case of the purchase of bank shares through
a broker, if the principal have notice (<i>e.g.</i> by the receipt of
the bought note) that the contract effected by the broker
does not comply with Leeman’s Act, and if he does not
repudiate it, the broker will be justified in paying the purchase-money
on his principal’s behalf. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Barclay</i> v.
<i>Pearce</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At least this seems
to be the effect of the case of <i>Barclay</i> v. <i>Pearce</i>.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c015'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Defendant
instructed plaintiff, who was a stockbroker, to purchase
shares in the Oriental Bank. The usual bought note was
sent to the defendant, but neither this nor the contract with
the jobber contained the numbers of the shares purchased,
nor the name of the registered owner, as required by the Act.
The “name day” was the 29th, on which day the name of
the defendant as the purchaser was handed to the jobber.
The transfer was duly executed.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the rules of the Stock Exchange the plaintiff was personally
responsible to the jobber for the payment of the
purchase-money. It is customary in dealings in bank shares
to disregard Leeman’s Act. The plaintiff paid the purchase-money
and sued to recover from defendant. There was no
proof that defendant had revoked the plaintiff’s authority to
pay. The Court held that the plaintiff having at defendant’s
request entered into a contract on which he was personally
responsible, though it was void at law, was entitled to
recover for money paid to defendant’s use. It was also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>intimated that until <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i> was reversed by
the House of Lords, it would be immaterial whether the
authority to pay had been revoked or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, submitted that it would have been competent
for the defendant to have repudiated the transaction
before the transfer was executed when he discovered that
the statute had not been complied with, and that in that case
the plaintiff’s authority would have been revoked. According
to <i>Neilson</i> v. <i>James</i>, the usage of the Stock Exchange to
disregard the Act would not bind the principal, at any rate
unless he acquiesced in it. The distinction between this case
and <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i> seems to be that in the latter case the
agent was employed to carry out a contract necessarily void
as being a wager. In this case the contract might have been
carried out so as to be legally binding, and there would probably
be no presumption that the instructions were to make
other than a legal agreement.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the matter has lately been confirmed by the
Court of Appeal in <i>Perry</i> v. <i>Barnett</i>.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c015'><sup>[276]</sup></a> The facts of this case
arose out of the Oriental Bank. The plaintiffs, stockbrokers,
had at defendant’s request bought for him 100 shares in
that Bank on the London Stock Exchange. The bought
note did not comply with Leeman’s Act, and next day the
bank closed its doors and defendant refused to complete the
purchase. The plaintiffs were really Bristol stockbrokers,
but as the shares could not be obtained in the Bristol market,
they, with defendant’s knowledge, instructed their London
agent to purchase them in London. <span class='sc'>Grove, J.</span>, decided in
favour of the defendant on the ground that he was not shown
to have known or acquiesced in the custom to disregard
Leeman’s Act. On appeal it was thought to distinguish the
case from <i>Neilson</i> v. <i>James</i> on the ground that in that case
the broker was instructed to sell shares which the plaintiff
had in his possession, and so he might without inconvenience
have complied with the Act. By Rule 68 of
the London Stock Exchange no bargain on the Stock
Exchange will be annulled by the committee except on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>ground of fraud. The Court affirmed the decision of
<span class='sc'>Grove, J.</span>, in favour of the defendant. (1) Adopting the
principles on which <i>Neilson</i> v. <i>James</i> was decided, the custom
or practice to disregard the Act was unreasonable, and so
could not bind persons who were ignorant of it. Per
<span class='sc'>Bowen, J.</span>, “It is as regards outsiders only who are
ignorant of the custom that such an usage can be called
unreasonable.” (2) Rule 68 is unreasonable, so not binding
to persons who have not consented to be bound by it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Seymour</i> v. <i>Bridge</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>This case must not be taken as overruling another of the
same kind decided by Mr. Justice <span class='sc'>Mathew</span> about the same
time, <i>Seymour</i> v. <i>Bridge</i>.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c015'><sup>[277]</sup></a> His lordship decided in favour of
the plaintiff, on the ground that the defendant knew of the
customary course of dealing in bank shares, though he was
ignorant of Leeman’s Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, in a late case before the Court of Appeal, <i>Coates</i>
v. <i>Pacey</i><a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c015'><sup>[278]</sup></a> which was another action by a broker against a
client for indemnity in respect of a purchase of bank shares,
the Court threw out serious doubts whether the same right
of indemnity which had been established in favour of an
agent employed to make bets for his principal existed in
the case of a broker even when authorised to deal in bank
shares in contravention of Leeman’s Act.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Actual transfer not affected.</div>

<p class='c007'>It seems clear that the Act only avoids the contract for
purchase and sale, it does not affect a transfer executed in
pursuance of such contract. In <i>Mortimer</i> v. <i>MacCallan</i><a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c015'><sup>[279]</sup></a> the
action was brought for the price of government stocks, sold
and actually transferred to defendant in pursuance of a contract
void under s. 8 of Barnard’s Act, 7 Geo. II., c. 8, the
plaintiff not having the stocks in his possession at the time
of the contract. It was <i>held</i> that the action was maintainable,
as it was based on the transfer and not on the
contract: at p. 640 “it was not a contract to sell, but a sale;
not a contract to transfer, but a transfer:” at page 643,
“Although the original contract of sale should be illegal on
the part of the seller, yet the transfer is a legal act for a
legal purpose&#160;... a promise to pay in consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of a transfer actually made, is neither prohibited by the
words nor within the intent of the statute.” As suggested
above, this is probably the real explanation of <i>Barclay</i> v.
<i>Pearce</i>, p. 120.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indemnity for calls.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Loring</i> v. <i>Davis</i><a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c015'><sup>[280]</sup></a> a question arose as to the right of
the plaintiff, as vendor of bank shares, to indemnity against
calls. It was found by <span class='sc'>Chitty, J.</span>, as a fact, that the
defendant, while knowing of his right to repudiate the
transaction under Leeman’s Act, authorised his brokers to
complete it on settling day; that the brokers in accepting
the transfers from the plaintiff’s brokers thereby made the
defendant equitable owner of the shares, and therefore liable
to indemnify the plaintiff.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>REVIEW OF THE LAW RELATING TO WAGER-CONTRACTS.</h3>

<p class='c019'>The present seems a favourable opportunity for a short
review of the state of our law on the subject of wagering.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several ways in which the matter may be treated
by the Legislature. It may declare the practice illegal in
the sense of punishable, and endeavour to stamp it out by the
machinery of the criminal law. This was the course adopted
by the Statute of Anne, which made it penal to win more
than £10 at one time or sitting by betting or gaming.
Again, Barnard’s Act made it a criminal act to gamble in
the funds, or even to settle differences on transactions of that
nature. This species of legislation seems open to objection.
Such a law must be uncertain in operation, as the offence is
difficult to prove; and what is, perhaps, worse, it is still more
difficult to disprove, and so capable of being turned into an
instrument of extortion or revenge. But there are alternatives
of a less violent character. It is possible to make
wagering transactions illegal, not in the sense of criminal,
but as contrary to public policy; the result of which would
be, as it has been endeavoured to explain in an earlier part of
this work, not only that the contracts themselves would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>unenforceable, but that they would vitiate, at any rate as
between the parties to the wager, every instrument or
security, whether under seal or not; they would taint every
contract or transaction arising out of or connected with the
original wager. Thus the turf commission agent would not
be able to recover what he had paid on his principal’s behalf
if he allowed himself to be employed in a transaction contrary
to the policy or the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Statute of Anne, and in Barnard’s Act, another
means was resorted to of restricting the practice, viz., they
gave the person who had lost and paid over a certain sum,
a right of action to recover it within a given period. This
might be a more efficacious method of repression than any
other, as it is difficult to see how bookmakers could conduct
a successful business, if in addition to the chances of never
being paid, they could not call the money they had in their
pockets their own. But the wisdom of such a species of
legislation seems very questionable; as being in favour of
dishonest persons it eventually operates to the disadvantage
of persons who are ready to discharge their debts of honour.
Besides, it hits the practice of betting in its least objectionable
point. The payment of a bet implies that a man has
not “plunged” beyond his means, particularly where the
contract cannot be enforced against him. The object of the
law is to discourage excessive gaming on credit, whereby
persons might incur liabilities which their means can never
enable them to meet.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is yet another alternative course, which is summed
up in the attitude which our law, in its present condition,
assumes towards betting. In technical language, it declares
wager-contracts void without making them illegal; it regards
them as things not to be encouraged, but not absolutely forbidden,
maintaining a neutral position as between the parties
without being positively hostile. It will probably have become
evident from the foregoing pages that the English law on the
subject is in a somewhat peculiar state. In the first place its
condition is decidedly piecemeal. To know the law in full it
is necessary to refer to four different statutes, the dates of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>which, from first to last, extend over a period of about two
hundred years. The Statutes of Charles II. and Anne must
be studied before the effect and meaning of the Statute of
William IV. can be made intelligible. But the latter
statute, at any rate in its present application, deals only with
cheques and securities given for betting debts, and that, too,
only where the bet is made on a horse race, or some other
game or pastime. Such securities it declares to be given for
an illegal consideration. The contracts themselves are the
subject matter of another statute passed a few years afterwards,
which by a broad and sweeping enactment, very little
in the style of English statute law, makes all wagers, of any
sort whatever, not illegal, but void and unenforceable. It
seems an anomaly that while all bets of themselves are simply
void, yet when once a cheque is given in discharge or payment
thereof, we are compelled to distinguish between bets
on games and bets not on games; the former, directly the
cheque is signed, becomes illegal, while a similar transformation
is not effected in the case of the latter. The law at any
rate seems capable of greater uniformity in this respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another peculiarity of the law lies in this—that while
wagers themselves cannot be made the subject of an action,
yet in many cases they can be practically enforced by the
joint exercise of legal and non-legal sanctions. This is
specially the case with regard to betting on the turf, a
large quantity of which is carried on, not directly between
principals, but through the medium of betting agents. The
agent makes the bet in his own name, and, so far as the
other party is concerned, is the principal. If the bet is lost,
the agent is, of course, under no legal obligation to pay.
But these turf agents are members of what may be called a
profession, and the dealings between the members are regulated
by the strictest etiquette, a breach of which might
entail serious consequences. It is well known that where an
agent makes a bet, it is he who, by the rules of the turf, is
responsible for payment. Some of the consequences of
default were dwelt upon in the case of <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>;
but suffice it to say that a defaulter is practically turned out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of his profession. So that payment is enforced against the
agent just as effectually as it could be made the ground of
an action at law. He must, if he can, obtain indemnity
from his principal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is at this stage that the law steps in. When an agent
has paid money on behalf of his principal the law gives
the agent a right of indemnity. If the agent has been
employed in a betting transaction, this right, says the law,
arises not out of a wager but out of an implied promise
by the principal to save the agent harmless from all the
consequences of his performing his instructions. The
principal knows that if the bet is lost the agent must
pay; consequently the doctrine of an implied promise of
indemnity applies equally where the transaction effected by
the agent was void as being in the nature of a wager.<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c015'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
So eventually a transaction which, as between principals,
the law would not recognise, is practically enforced by a
circuitous process when effected through the medium of an
agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the inconsistency is seeming rather than real. The
contract between the principal and the agent is not in the
nature of a wager. It is more in the nature of a contract
of loan. A promise by A that he will make B a present
of £5 gives B no ground of action against A; it is simply
void. But A employs C to go and pay the money on his
behalf. C can, of course, recover what he has paid, from A.
So a wager is nothing more than void, like the promise of a
gift; it is not illegal. And this is the real explanation of
the matter. The law does not forbid people to bet, so that
in compelling the principal to indemnify his agent it is not
enforcing any transaction contrary to its own policy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further, be it remembered, the law in its present state is
not open to the charge of one-sidedness: the rights of the
principal and the agent are reciprocal. The agent has the
same hold over the bookmaker that the latter has over him;
he could visit him with the ordinary penalties of default.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>But the agent who has received “winnings” on a bet, can
no more refuse to account to his principal, than can a
principal refuse to reimburse the agent who has paid losses.
So eventually, in cases where the commission agent
intervenes, fair dealing is enforced as between all parties. It
is also worthy of consideration that actions in which betting
transactions are involved, but which come before the Courts
on a question as between principal and agent, are not open to
the same objection as the actions which were allowed to be
brought directly on the wager itself, and which necessitated
the trial of absurd and frivolous issues. The interposition of
an agent occurs, of course, almost exclusively in betting on
the turf; and it may be taken that actions between principal
and agent with respect to wagers will in all cases be
concerned with wagers on horse-races. But in all such
races there is a regularly established process for deciding as
to the winner, and it is not likely that a man who was sued
by a turf commission agent for reimbursements would be
allowed to raise any question as to the correctness of the
decision of the judge or the stewards of the race. In these
cases, therefore, the time of the Courts is never taken up
with disputes as to the event on which the bet was made—an
inconvenience which in former times drove the judges to
the extreme measure of putting all wager actions at the
bottom of the cause list.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course it must not be forgotten that the law as settled
in <i>Read</i> v. <i>Anderson</i> is yet subject to reversal by the House
of Lords, a contingency which would materially affect the
interests of turf commission agents; but so long as the
decision of the Court of Appeal remains undisturbed, the
law is that the agent who has made a bet in his own name
has an irrevocable authority to pay the bet, if lost, on his
principal’s behalf; and can recover the amount from him.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>N.B.</i>—Since these observations were written the Gaming
Amendment Act, 1892, has, as has been pointed out above,<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c015'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
made some modifications in the law. The agent can no
longer sue, though he can be sued.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c013'>LOTTERIES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>A lottery has been defined to be “a distribution of prizes
by lot or chance,” a definition which was accepted as correct
by the Court in <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Smetten</i>,<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c015'><sup>[283]</sup></a> but which seems somewhat
incomplete considering the complexity of the subject,
see <i>post</i> p. 140 as to the tests of a lottery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The setting up of lotteries has been declared illegal and
penal by a long series of statutes commencing in the reign
of William III. The full text of these statutes will be
found in Chitty’s Statutes (title “Gaming”). It will be
sufficient to summarise them for the purpose of the present
work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>10 &#38; 11 Wm. III., c. 17.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Statute 10 &#38; 11 William III., ch. 17, reciting that
persons had of late fraudulently obtained great sums of
money from the children and servants of merchants and
traders by colour of patents or grants under the Great Seal,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lotteries
declared
nuisances.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
enacts by Section 1 that all such lotteries are common and
public nuisances and all patents and licence for the same
void.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Penalty of £500 for keeping a lottery.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That no person should after the 29th of December,
1699, publicly or privately exercise, keep open, show or
expose to be played at, drawn at or thrown at, any kind of
lottery by dice, lots, cards, balls, under penalty of £500.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>£20 for playing at such lotteries.</div>

<p class='c007'>(3.) All persons playing, throwing or drawing at such
lotteries, or any other lotteries are liable to a penalty of
£20.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>9 Geo. I., c. 19. Foreign lotteries.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 9 George I., c. 19, a penalty of £200 is inflicted for
setting up any lottery by virtue of a grant from any foreign
prince or issuing any advertisement for the same; also
for selling tickets within the kingdom for any foreign
lottery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>6 Geo. II., c. 35. £200 penalty for selling chances in foreign lotteries.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>It seems that the latter statute was evaded by persons
issuing tickets for numbers in foreign lotteries and setting
up duplicates of such lotteries in this kingdom. So by
6 George II., c. 35, a penalty of £200 is imposed for selling
or procuring any ticket, receipt, chance, or number in any
foreign lottery, or in or belonging to any class, part, or
division of such lottery, or any ticket for any duplicate of
any foreign lottery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>12 Geo. II., c. 28. £200 penalty for setting up sales by lotteries.</div>

<p class='c007'>12 George II., c. 28, inflicts a penalty of £200 for setting
up any office or place under the denomination of “a sale of
houses, land, advowson, presentations, plate, jewels, ships’
goods, or other things by way of lottery,” <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Advertising
for advances
to be distributed

lottery.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
or for advertising
for advances of sums of money amounting in the whole to
large sums to be divided among the subscribers by chances
of the prizes in some lottery allowed by Act of Parliament,
or for exposing for sale any of the above things by any
game, method or device whatsoever to be determined by any
lot or drawing.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 2 the games of ace of hearts, pharaoh, bassett
and hazard are declared to be games or lotteries within the
meaning of the recited Act, with the same penalties for
setting up the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sec. 3. Persons playing at games mentioned in the Act liable to £20 penalty.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 3 players or adventurers in any of the games
mentioned in the Act, viz., ace of hearts, pharaoh,
bassett and hazard, are liable to a penalty of £20; the same
penalty is inflicted on persons taking part in any such
lottery or sale.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>All sales by lotteries declared void.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 4 makes all sales by lotteries void, and the subject
matter of the lottery is forfeited to the person who shall sue
for the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Division among joint tenants by lot lawful.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 11 provides that it shall be lawful for joint tenants
and tenants in common to make partition of their
several interests by lot as though the Act had not been
passed.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c015'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>13 Geo. II., c. 19, passage and games with dice.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 13 George II., c. 19, sec. 9, passage and all other
games with dice, backgammon excepted, are declared to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>lotteries within the last Act, with similar penalties on
persons who “maintain, set up or keep, any office, table or
place,” for such games, and on persons who “play, set at,
stake or adventure” in the said games.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>18 Geo. II., c. 34, Roly-Poly.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 18 George II., c. 34, secs. 1 and 2 impose similar
penalties in respect of setting up a house or place for or
allowing roly-poly, or playing thereat.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c015'><sup>[285]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>42 Geo. III., c. 119, Littlegoes declared to be lotteries.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 42 George III., c. 119, section 1, all games or lotteries
called “Littlegoes” are declared to be public nuisances.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Penalty £500 for keeping a lottery.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 2 any person keeping any office or place to
exercise, show, or expose, to be drawn or thrown at by dice
lots, cards, balls, numbers, or figures, or any other contrivance,
any lottery called a littlego or any other lottery,
or any person suffering the same to be carried on in his or
her house, is made liable to a penalty of £500.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3. Persons not proceeded against for such penalties
may be convicted as rogues and vagabonds within the
meaning of 17 and 27 George II.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 4. Power is given to any justice of the peace upon
information on oath to issue a warrant authorising any person
(but if by night then in the presence of a constable) to break
open and enter any house or place where they have information
of any offence being committed within this Act, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Persons
aiding and
abetting in
lotteries.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and
to apprehend all offenders and all persons aiding and
abetting in any such offence. The latter are punishable as
rogues and vagabonds.</p>

<p class='c007'>The section also provides that persons obstructing any
such officer in the execution of his duty shall be liable to be
“fined, imprisoned, and publicly whipped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 4. Persons employing others in carrying on such
lotteries to be deemed rogues and vagabonds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 5. No person is to agree to pay money or to
deliver goods on any event or contingency relative to the
drawing of any tickets, lots, or numbers in any such lottery
under penalty of £100.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Place.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 4 George IV., c. 60, s. 60, the word “place” is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>declared to extend to any place in or out of an enclosed
building, whether on land or water.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 31 any person selling tickets in any lottery
authorised by any foreign potentate, or to be drawn in any
country, or any lottery not authorised by Act of Parliament,
or publishing any scheme for the sale of tickets, is liable to
a fine of £50, and to be dealt with as a rogue and vagabond.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tickets.</div>

<p class='c007'>4 George IV., c. 60, s. 41, provides that any person
selling tickets in any lottery or publishing any scheme for
the sale of tickets, shall be punished as a rogue and vagabond.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>46 Geo. III. c. 148. All proceedings to be taken in the Attorney-General’s name.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 46 George III., c. 148, it is provided that all penalties
under the former Act, or any act concerning lotteries, are
to go to the Crown, and to be sued for only in the Attorney-General’s
name.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c015'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>6 &#38; 7 Wm. IV., c. 66. £50 penalty for advertising any lottery or ticket.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 6 and 7 William IV., c. 66, a penalty of £50 is
imposed on any person who prints or publishes any advertisement
or other notice relating to the drawing of any
foreign or other lottery not authorised by Act of Parliament,
half the penalty to go to the informer, half to the Crown.
The same penalty is imposed for printing advertisements of
the sale of tickets or chances in any lottery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>8 &#38; 6 Vict., c. 74. Penalties to go to Crown.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 8 and 9 Vict., c. 74, to save newspaper proprietors the
annoyance of being sued for inadvertently advertising
lotteries contrary to the Act, it is enacted that all penalties
shall go to the Crown, and proceedings only instituted in
the Attorney-General’s name.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indian law.</div>

<p class='c007'>By the Indian Penal Code, 294<span class='fss'>A</span>, it is made an offence to
keep any “office or place” for drawing any lottery not
authorised by Government, also to publish any proposal to
pay money or deliver goods on an event to be determined by
drawing, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The English cases will in most cases be applicable to the
construction of the term “lottery” in the Indian law. And
as to what constitutes “a place,” reference should be made
to a subsequent part of this work on betting houses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Private house or club.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Of course a lottery is equally illegal when carried on in a
private house or club as in a public place. The words of
section 2, of 42 George III., put this beyond doubt. Thus,
in <i>Mearing</i> v. <i>Helling</i>,<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a> which was the case of an ordinary
Derby sweep in a club, it was held that the drawer of the
winner could not recover the stakes, the transaction being
illegal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Summary of the Statutes.</div>

<p class='c007'>To sum up the provisions of the statutes, the following
seem to be offences constituted:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Keeping a lottery.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Setting up a lottery. This, obviously directed
against anyone presiding over a gambling establishment in
the same way as subsequent Acts, makes it illegal to keep a
bank in a gaming house, or a betting table, as against all
comers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Players or punters.</div>

<p class='c007'>In all the Acts, it will be noticed that this is the first
offence specified.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) The next offence is playing at any of the unlawful
games<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c015'><sup>[288]</sup></a>; in which matter the Lottery Acts differ from the
Acts against gaming and betting houses. The leading provision
in this matter is section 3 of the Act of William III.,
which is perfectly general in its terms. First it speaks of
playing, &#38;c., at “the said lotteries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Act had stopped there, it might have been contended
that the players were only liable where the lottery was of
the kind mentioned in section 2 of that Act; <i>i.e.</i>, where there
was somebody, as it were, holding the bank as against the
rest; but the Act further goes on to say, “or other
lotteries.” These words seem quite wide enough to include
the common case of members of a club combining together
to make a Derby sweep, which is quite a distinct case from
a man getting up a lottery and inviting others to gamble
with him; and so it seems to have been held in <i>Mearing</i> v.
<i>Helling</i>.<a href='#f287' class='c015'><sup>[287]</sup></a> See 12 George II., c. 28, s. 3.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, it is not very likely that the law would be
enforced in such a case; as we have seen above, the penalties
could only be recovered at the suit of the Attorney-General.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>It seems clear also that the term “common nuisance,”
“rogue and vagabond,” only applies to the case of a man
who sets up a lottery; it does not apply to the adventurers.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Advertising lotteries at home or abroad.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tickets.</div>

<p class='c007'>(4.) Issuing or selling tickets at home or abroad.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Agent or stakeholder.</div>

<p class='c007'>(5.) It is clear that any one acting as agent for another in
a lottery is equally guilty of “maintaining,” “setting-up,”
or “exposing;” probably a stakeholder could be made
liable as “aiding and abetting” within section 4 of 42
George III., c. 119.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Foreign lotteries.</div>

<p class='c007'>(6.) With regard to foreign lotteries, the offences constituted
are: (<i>a</i>) Setting up, or selling tickets for, lotteries by
virtue of a grant from any foreign power. 9 Geo. I., c. 19.
(<i>b</i>) Issuing tickets for numbers in foreign lotteries, and
setting up duplicates of such lotteries. 6 Geo. II., c. 35.
(<i>c</i>) Selling tickets for any lottery authorised by any foreign
power, or in any lottery unless authorised by Act of Parliament,
and publishing scheme for the sale of such tickets.
4 Geo. IV., c. 60, s. 41. (<i>d</i>) Publishing any advertisement
relating to the drawing of any foreign lottery, or to the
sale of tickets therein. 6 &#38; 7 Wm. IV., c. 66.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>MacNee</i> v. <i>Persian Investment Corporation</i><a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c015'><sup>[289]</sup></a> the defendant
company was formed for the purpose (<i><span lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) of carrying
into effect an agreement, whereby the defendant company were
to secure a monopoly of all operations in Persia relating to
loans redeemable by drawings with bonuses and to lotteries,
the promotion of lottery companies, and the sale of lottery
tickets. The defendants’ prospectus stated the main object
of the company to be to promote lottery loans on the lines
in vogue on the Continent, and that five issues would be
made annually in Persia. <i>Held</i> that the agreement was
not illegal within 9 Geo. I., c. 19, which statute (<i>semble</i>
except as to the sale of tickets) only applied to lotteries in
this country. Nor was it within 6 &#38; 7 Wm. IV., c. 66,
seeing that it was a mere general intimation as to future
lotteries, not an announcement of any particular lottery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>It should be observed that it was consistent with the agreement
and the prospectus that all the operations of the
company should be conducted in Persia.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What amounts to a lottery. <i>Allport</i> v. <i>Nutt</i> Sweepstakes.</div>

<p class='c007'>The following cases show what will constitute a lottery
within the meaning of the Acts:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Allport</i> v. <i>Nutt</i><a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c015'><sup>[290]</sup></a> plaintiff sued for £100, having subscribed
£1 to an adventure on the terms that a certain race
being about to be run, the name of each of the horses
entered for the running should be put on a separate card,
and that all should be mixed up in a box; and the same
with the names of the subscribers, which were put into
another box; that one card should be drawn out of the
horse box, and then one card out of the other. The person
whose name should be drawn out after the horse which
should afterwards win the race should win £100. Defendant
pleaded that the transaction amounted to a lottery, or, in
the alternative, to a wager under the Statute of Anne. In
answer to this, plaintiff urged that the Lottery Acts only
contemplated cases where unfair advantage was taken,
relying for this argument on the recitals contained in the
Statute of William III.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Suggested distinction between lotteries and sweepstakes.</div>

<p class='c007'>It was further argued that this transaction was a sweepstakes,
and not a lottery. “The difference” (argued
Serjeant Byles) “between a lottery and a sweepstakes is
this: in a lottery, the party getting it up receives from the
purchasers of tickets more than the value of the prizes;
whereas in a sweepstakes all the money obtained from the
subscribers is paid over to the winners; the party to whom
the subscriptions are paid is a mere stakeholder.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Argument that lotteries for legal horse-race not illegal.</div>

<p class='c007'>It was also contended that a lottery to be determined by
the event of a legal horse-race was not prohibited; that
“all the Lottery Acts contemplate a scheme whereby the
actor is attempting to enrich himself at the expense of the
community. The transaction in this case is nothing more
than betting on a legal horse-race, no single individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>staking more than £1.”<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c015'><sup>[291]</sup></a> But the Court overruled all these
arguments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words “all other lotteries,” and “any other lottery
whatsoever,” used in the statutes, were wide enough to take
in the present case, thus embracing what are commonly
known as sweepstakes. “The mischief,” says <span class='sc'>Cresswell, J.</span>,
“intended to be remedied is, the introduction of a spirit of
speculation and gambling, tending to the ruin and impoverishment
of families, and not, as suggested, the gain
acquired by the individual. Suppose a horse were sold by
tickets amounting in the aggregate to the true value, would
not that be a lottery?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Gatty</i> v. <i>Field</i></div>

<p class='c007'>This case was followed in <i>Gatty</i> v. <i>Field</i>,<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c015'><sup>[292]</sup></a> where sums of
15s. were deposited by subscribers with a secretary previous
to a horse-race. The name of each horse entered for the
running was put on a separate card; these cards were mixed
up in a box; the names of the subscribers were then written
on other cards, and mixed up in another box. Cards were
drawn alternately out of the horse box and out of the other
box, just in the same way as in <i>Allport</i> v. <i>Nutt</i>; the winner
being also determined in the same way. <i>Held</i> that this was
illegal as a lottery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Distribution of presents at entertainment.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Blackman</i>,<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c015'><sup>[293]</sup></a> an attempt was made to evade the
law by setting up a lottery under the guise of distributing
presents gratuitously and capriciously among the audience.
Defendant kept a shop in the King’s Road, Brighton; in
the window of which watches, pieces of plate, and other
articles were exhibited, with a placard: “These presents,
with others, will be given away by W. Morris at the conclusion
of his entertainment at N. Rooms, Brighton, to-night
and every evening during the week.” There was also a
notice that tickets could be had within. A witness purchased
of Jeffs, Morris’ assistant, who was a co-defendant, a ticket
for a seat, and received a programme, in which it was stated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“at the conclusion of the entertainment Mr. Morris will
distribute amongst his audience a shower of gold and silver
treasure on a scale without parallel; besides a shower of
smaller presents, which will be impartially divided amongst
the audience and given away.” At the close of the entertainment,
a quantity of these “presents” were placed on a
table. Morris took up a butter-cooler, and awarded it to the
occupier of seat 345. Other “presents” were distributed in
the same way, the number of a seat being sometimes called
out which had no occupier.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Held</i> that as a question of fact the magistrates had rightly
decided that this was a mere contrivance to conceal what was
really a game or lottery within 42 George III., c. 119. Per
<span class='sc'>Pollock, C.B.</span>: “I have no doubt that not one of the
audience had the least notion that the proprietor was to give
the articles to any person he pleased: but that every one
thought he had a chance of winning.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Companies distributing benefits by lot.</div>

<p class='c007'>In some of the cases, it has been sought to impeach the
schemes of companies which contemplate the distribution of
dividends or other benefits by lot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in <i>O’Connor</i> v. <i>Bradshaw</i>,<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c015'><sup>[294]</sup></a> the objects of the Company
were to raise subscriptions in small sums, to purchase
land, erect dwellings thereon and allot them to its members
on such terms as should enable them to become freeholders
and obtain other privileges according to the number of shares
for which they subscribed. Their right to obtain these
privileges was not absolute, but depended on the result of a
ballot according to which a small number only of the subscribers
could obtain present possession of houses, &#38;c., and
the proportion of those who had obtained them during five
years was very small.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lord Chief Baron was of opinion that this scheme
constituted a lottery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baron <span class='sc'>Parke</span> was of another opinion, thinking that the
case came within section 11 of 12 George II., c. 28. He
also put another illustration: “Suppose a number of persons
were to buy a large collection of pictures some of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>far exceeded others in value, might it not be decided by
lot who should have the first choice?” But as the company
was illegal on another ground, this point was not
decided.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Sykes</i> v <i>Beadon</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>The next case of this kind is <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Beadon</i>.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c015'><sup>[295]</sup></a> The
association was formed on the principle of investing the subscriptions
of the members and dividing the capital fund and
profits among themselves by means of certificates convertible
by annual drawings by lot into preference dividend bonds
bearing interest with a bonus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Building societies distinguished.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Master of the Rolls without deciding the point finally,
said (p. 185), “I have grave doubts whether this association is
not illegal, as being within the Lottery Acts. Building
societies are in a different position—they are loan societies.
In an association such as this, it is not a case of loans to be
returned, but of subscriptions to be divided. The subscriptions
are to be divided among the subscribers by drawings by
lot, and the prize is a bond with a bonus.” (At p. 190) “The
holders of certificates are persons who subscribe money to be
invested in funds which are to be divided among them by lot
and divided unequally. That is the persons who get the
benefit of the drawings get a bond bearing interest and a
bonus which gives them different advantages from the persons
whose certificates are not drawn, and it depends upon chance
which gets the lesser or the greater advantage. It is, therefore,
a subscription by a number of persons to a fund for
the purpose of dividing that fund between them by chance
and unequally.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is not a lottery it is very difficult, at all events
to my mind, to understand what a lottery is. It is called
a division by lot, which means lottery. It says that the
selections of certificates shall be by lot, and that is to be
done in the ordinary way, by chance, and the benefits, as I
said before, are unequal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next company which it was sought to bring within
the Lottery Acts was the Mutual Society—a sort of building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>society.<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c015'><sup>[296]</sup></a> <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Wallingford</i>
v. <i>Mutual
Society</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The objects of this society were to accumulate
capital by means of monthly subscriptions from members to
advance capital to the members in rotation, to secure payment
of such advances, and to divide profits among the
members. The mode of operation was to obtain subscriptions
from members, to advance them money, at interest,
upon certificates of appropriation. Such certificates should
be given to every member on joining the society, and should
certify his right to receive advances and a share of profits.
Holders of life certificates were entitled to tontine bonuses.
An “appropriation” or advance was to be made according
to the number of certificates held by the member successful
in obtaining the appropriation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Appropriations were to be allotted in two ways, the
first and every fourth one thereafter by drawing, free
of any premium or interest, while those intermediate
appropriations were allotted to the member or members
tendering the highest premium for the same respectively.
Appropriations were to be repaid by quarterly instalments.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was urged that the constitution of this society was
illegal under the Lottery Acts, as the benefits of the society
were to be given to the members by drawings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court were unanimous in holding that the society was
not within the Lottery Acts. Per Lord <span class='sc'>Selborne</span>: “One
of those Acts plainly, on the face of its recitals (the enacting
part not departing from the recitals) had reference to gambling
transactions only; and in my judgment this was not a
gambling transaction within the meaning of that Act.” The
other had reference to persons who kept lottery offices at
which the public were invited to pay for lottery tickets; and
that Act could have no application to this case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Per Lord <span class='sc'>Hatherley</span>: “If this were held to be a lottery,
nearly every building society and a great many other
societies framed upon a similar footing might be found to
fall within the enactments against lotteries.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conflict between the two cases.</div>

<p class='c007'>It does not seem easy to reconcile the dicta of the Master
of the Rolls with the decision of the House of Lords in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>above case. It is true the Master of the Rolls draws the distinction
in the case of building societies that in them it is a
case of loans to be returned and not of subscriptions to be
divided. At the same time in both the cases seem to stand
on this common ground—that certain unequal benefits of the
society were to be distributed by lot or chance. Since this
decision of the House of Lords it must be taken that there is
nothing illegal in a company or partnership distributing
dividends or profits by drawing lots. In <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>
15 Ch. D., 247, it was admitted that <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Beadon</i> was
overruled by the Wallingford case (but see <i>post</i> for the
suggested text of a lottery).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No defence that all present get some benefit.</div>

<p class='c007'>In two cases it was contended that no scheme could amount
to a lottery in which the holders of the tickets all get some
value for their money, the amount or value being uncertain;
but in both it was held that the element of uncertainty was
sufficient to bring them within the Acts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>R.</i> v. <i>Harris</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Harris</i><a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c015'><sup>[297]</sup></a> defendant announced a bazaar to be conducted
according to the principles of the Art Union. 5,000
tickets of 1s. each were to be sold; bonuses to the amount
of £250 were to be distributed by lot. Every holder of a
ticket got some bonus, but some bonuses were more valuable
than others. <i>Held</i> by <span class='sc'>M. Smith, J.</span>, that the fact that every
body got some bonus did not make it the less a lottery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Smetten</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>So in <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Smetten</i>.<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c015'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Defendant erected a tent, in
which he sold packets containing 1 lb. of tea each. In each
packet was a coupon entitling the purchaser to a prize, and
this was publicly stated by the defendant before the sale.
The purchasers were told to come next morning for their
prizes, the nature of which were unknown to them. It is not
stated in the report whether the prizes were drawn by lot, or
whether they were awarded at the caprice of defendant. <i>Held</i>
that this constituted a lottery. <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, says: “If the
coupon alone sealed up had been offered for sale, the
purchaser taking his chance whether it represented a pen or
a silver pencil case, or if a number written on a slip of paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>were sold entitling the purchaser to some article the name of
which was written against a corresponding number in an
undisclosed list, could any one doubt these would have been
lotteries? To use it is utterly immaterial whether a specific
article was or was not conjoined with the chance.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Advertisement not necessary.</div>

<p class='c007'>Nor is it essential that the nature of the prizes distributable
should be publicly announced or advertised if the
scheme itself is in the nature of a lottery. <i>Hunt</i> v.
<i>Williams</i>.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c015'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Racing coupons.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Caminada</i> v. <i>Hulton</i><a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c015'><sup>[300]</sup></a> the legality of the racing coupons
came before the Court. The case was of the ordinary kind,
the defendant, to increase the sale of his paper, appended to
each copy a coupon which the purchaser might, if he chose,
fill up with the names of horses he thought likely to win one
or more races, according to the conditions, and those persons
who should be successful in selecting a given number of
winners were to be entitled to a prize. It was held that this
was not a lottery seeing that the competitors selected their
own horses; there was no distribution by lot. This case will
be noticed again in the chapter on Betting Houses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Suggested test of a lottery.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is suggested, not without some diffidence, that the following
considerations form the test of whether a transaction
is or is not a lottery. There must be an agreement or
scheme contemplating that in consideration of subscriptions
paid by the adventurers certain property (be it the fund
subscribed or otherwise) is to be allotted to some one or more
exclusively of the other adventurers, or distributed unequally
among them; such allotment or distribution to be determined
by lot. But it would seem material to notice:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) The agreement may be amongst the subscribers
themselves, as in the case of a sweepstakes, see <i>Allport</i> v.
<i>Nutt</i>,<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c015'><sup>[301]</sup></a> or by the subscribers with a person who is getting
the lottery up, perhaps for his own profit.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) It must be part of the scheme that some of the
adventurers should win and others should lose, as Lord
<span class='sc'>Selborne</span> observed in <i>Wallingford</i> v. <i>The Mutual Society</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>that the statutes have reference to gambling transactions
only. This is as in wagers, <i><span lang="la">vide sup.</span></i> p. 32.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The distribution of the prizes must be by lot or
chance, herein differing from a wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) The distribution of the prizes must be in consideration
of property subscribed by the adventurers out of property
belonging to them individually. There would appear to be
nothing contrary to the Lottery Acts in joint owners
dividing their property by lot. Sec. 11 of 12 George II.,
c. 28, specially exempts partition by lot among joint owners
of land. But this is quite a different idea from making
a contribution for the purpose of a division by lot.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5.) The distribution of the prizes by lot must be the
main substantial part of the scheme to which the adventurers
subscribe. This may serve as the true explanation why
companies whose regulations provide for a distribution of
profits by lot are not within the Lottery Acts. In these
cases we have commercial undertakings, whose main and
primary object is to make money in a legitimate way,
whether by profitable investment, as in <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Beadon</i>, or
trade enterprise. The distribution of these profits is, though
important, purely secondary. It does not seem to be, as
suggested by the Master of the Rolls in that case, a case
merely “of subscriptions to be divided”; the profits had
to be earned first. No doubt the line between the cases
may sometimes be very fine. Several people agree to subscribe
to buy a mare and then to raffle for it. This would seem
clearly to be a lottery,<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c015'><sup>[302]</sup></a> though <i><span lang="la">secus</span></i> if the agreement to
raffle were made after the purchase. But suppose the agreement
were to buy several mares for the purpose of breeding
from them and to raffle for the offspring; this case would
seem to stand on the same footing as the case of the companies;
the primary object is the breeding of horses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bazaars</div>

<p class='c007'>The question never seems to have been raised whether
bazaars conducted on the now somewhat common system of
selling things by drawing of lots do not infringe the Lottery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Acts. Such bazaars are usually held for the purpose of
raising money for a charity. The method of operation in
many cases is for a certain number of subscribers to pay
down a specified sum of money each, and then articles of a
different value are distributed among those subscribers, by
drawing of lots, some of the articles being of greater value
than others, every subscriber getting something for his
ticket. It is clear from the authorities above quoted, that
the latter circumstance does not take the case out of the
Lottery Acts. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>“Fish
ponds.”<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So also articles are sold at these bazaars by
raffle, or by a more modern institution called a “fish pond,”
in which a quantity of articles of unequal value, and all
under cover, are placed together; and the subscribers, with a
sort of fishing rod and line and a hook attached at the end,
endeavour to fish up some article, the value of which of
course is uncertain until taken out of its cover. It seems
difficult to avoid the conclusion that if such bazaars are
conducted on any of the systems above alluded to they
infringe the provisions of 12 George II., c. 28, section 1.,
which prohibits the sale or exposing for sale of goods, &#38;c.,
by any method or device to be determined by lot or drawing,
thus prohibiting any lottery being carried on under the
guise of a sale. Section 3 of the same Act seems to apply
to any person buying at any such sales—it inflicts a penalty
of £20 on any adventurer in the games forbidden by the
Act, and on any person taking part in such lottery or sale.
Whether it would be wise or tolerable that the law should
be enforced in every case in all its strictness is another
question, but it would be wise for persons who get up these
bazaars, even with the most charitable motives, and ladies
who take stalls therein, to consider the Lottery Acts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lotteries illegal, not merely void as agreements.</div>

<p class='c007'>Of course as the statutes have imposed penalties for setting
up lotteries it follows that an agreement which has for its
object any transaction which amounts to a lottery or of
which such transaction forms any part is tainted with
illegality. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Results of
illegality.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The chief results of a contract being illegal
have been noted above in treating of bills and securities
given for an illegal consideration. In some few cases the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>application of these rules to lottery transactions is
illustrated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Whole transaction tainted.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Fisher</i> v. <i>Bridges</i><a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c015'><sup>[303]</sup></a> defendant agreed to sell to plaintiff
a piece of land at a certain price, for the purpose, as plaintiff
well knew, that the land should be exposed for sale by
lottery contrary to the statute.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c015'><sup>[304]</sup></a> Defendant having paid
only a part of the purchase money after the sale was over,
entered into a covenant with plaintiff to pay the balance.
The defendant pleaded that the deed was given for an
illegal consideration, viz., the sale by lottery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court of Queen’s Bench held that as the deed was
made after the illegal transaction was over, and did not
appear by the plea to have been entered into in pursuance
of the previous illegal agreement, it was not affected with
the illegality; the grounds of their decision being that the
purchase money and the sum secured by the bond were not
necessarily identified.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Court of Exchequer Chamber reversed this
judgment on the ground that “the covenant was given
to secure the payment of a part of the purchase or consideration
money for the lands the subject of the agreement,
and no action could have been brought to recover the
purchase money of the lands. The covenant springs from,
and is a creation of, the legal agreement; and as the
law would not enforce the original illegal contract, so
neither will it allow the parties to enforce a security for the
purchase money, which by the original bargain was tainted
with illegality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Money paid in respect of a lottery.</div>

<p class='c007'>Another consequence of lotteries being illegal is seen in
the right of the person who has paid money in respect of
it to recover it back. Where the money has been deposited
with a <i>stakeholder</i>, the series of cases ending with <i>Diggle</i> v.
<i>Higgs</i>,<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c015'><sup>[305]</sup></a> given under “Wager Contracts,” show that notice
can in any case be given by the depositor to recall the
money before it has been paid over by the stakeholder.</p>

<p class='c007'>But where the deposit has in the first place been made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>with a person who sets up the lottery different considerations
prevail. The general rule is that where money has been
paid to a person in order to effect an illegal purpose with it
the person making the payment may recover the money
back before the purpose is effected. But where the illegal
purpose has been fully or partially executed it cannot be
recovered by the person who paid it, the rule “in pari
delicto, etc.,” has been held to apply.<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c015'><sup>[306]</sup></a> Therefore under the
first part of the rule above stated it is clear that the
depositor can always recover his money before the lottery
comes off.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems however in a lottery to be the same as in the
case of a wager, a depositor cannot sue the stakeholder
without previously giving notice to him that his authority
to pay the money over to the winner is determined.<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c015'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So in <i>Gatty</i> v. <i>Field</i><a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c015'><sup>[308]</sup></a> where the plaintiff had deposited
15s. as subscriber to a lottery and sued the stakeholder as
winner. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Demand
necessary.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was held that to entitle him to recover his own
subscription it was necessary for him previously to demand
it back from the stakeholder and so put an end to the illegal
transaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now to consider the case of the lottery having come
off. The rule of “<span lang="la">in pari delicto, etc.</span>” does not of course
apply where the <span lang="la">delictum</span> is not par.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c015'><sup>[309]</sup></a> Thus, in <i>Browning</i>
v. <i>Morris</i>,<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c015'><sup>[310]</sup></a> it was held that money paid by way of premium
for the insurance of lottery tickets to the keeper of a lottery
office was recoverable on the ground that the various statutes
(at least so it would seem<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c015'><sup>[311]</sup></a>) authorising the raising of money
by State lotteries forbade the keeping of offices for the
insurance of tickets, but imposed no penalty on the insurer—the
statute had “marked the criminal.” It seems,
however, that in the middle of the judgment it transpired
that the plaintiff himself was a lottery office keeper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>therefore himself “in pari delicto”; consequently a non-suit
was entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem, therefore, that where a person sets up or
maintains a lottery, receiving money on deposit in respect
thereof the subscribers can at any time recover what they
have paid. It is true that section 3 of the Act of
William III. and section 3 of 12 Geo. II., c. 28 impose
penalties on the adventurers. Still the statutes were passed
for the protection of the latter, and the heavier penalty is
imposed on the maintainer. In the case, however, of a
sweepstakes, which is simply an agreement between the
adventurers,<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c015'><sup>[312]</sup></a> the same considerations do not seem to
apply.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also clear both upon principle and on the authority
of <i>Allport</i> v. <i>Nutt</i><a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c015'><sup>[313]</sup></a> that no action will lie to recover money
alleged to be due as the winnings of a lottery. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Illegal
partnership
or society.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the case
of <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Beadon</i>,<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c015'><sup>[314]</sup></a> the Master of the Rolls held a society
to be illegal partly as infringing the Companies’ Acts and
partly as infringing the Lottery Acts. His lordship distinctly
opposed the dicta of Lord <span class='sc'>Cottenham</span> in <i>Sharp</i> v.
<i>Taylor</i><a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c015'><sup>[315]</sup></a> to the effect that a suit could be maintained by a
member of a firm formed for an illegal object for an
account of profits realised by such illegal business on the
ground that the Courts by affording such remedy in no way
facilitated the illegal object, which had already been
accomplished. The Master of the Rolls thought it made no
difference that the illegal transaction was closed. “It is no
part of the duty of a Court of Justice to aid either party
in carrying out an illegal contract, or in dividing the proceeds
arising from an illegal contract.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand it will be remembered that in <i>Beeston</i>
v. <i>Beeston</i><a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c015'><sup>[316]</sup></a> the principle of <i>Sharp</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> was spoken of
with approval: still the exact question under discussion
was not then raised, and it is submitted that the remarks of
<span class='sc'>Jessel, M.P.</span>, suggest the true principle. We shall deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>with this subject in greater detail when we come to discuss
partnership in Gaming Houses. See p. 162.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proceedings in lottery cases.</div>

<p class='c007'>There are three different ways in which offenders against
the Lottery Acts can be proceeded against:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indictment for a nuisance.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) By indictment for a nuisance, the keeping of lotteries
being declared to be a nuisance both by the Statutes of
William IV. and 42 Geo. III., c. 119.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Crawshaw</i><a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c015'><sup>[317]</sup></a> defendant was indicted under
10 &#38; 11 William III., c. 17, section 1, and also under 42
Geo. III., c. 119, section 1, for a common nuisance in
keeping a house lottery called a littlego. The evidence
showed that the defendant advertised drawings and sold
tickets for a lottery, in respect of which prizes were drawn
and awarded to the winners. It was argued for the defendant
that an indictment for a nuisance under section 1 of the
Act would not lie, because by section 2 of both Acts, a
specific penalty had been prescribed for setting up lotteries
after the dates mentioned therein, whereby the remedy for
a nuisance had been abrogated. But the Court held on the
authority of <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Gregory</i><a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c015'><sup>[318]</sup></a> that whenever Parliament has
declared an act to be a nuisance, the party may be indicted,
and that this form of proceeding had not been abrogated by
the provisions in section 2 of each of the Acts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Penalty of £500. Jurisdiction of justices taken away.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) By section 2 of 42 Geo. III., a penalty of £500 is
imposed for keeping any office or place to exercise any kind
of lottery.</p>

<p class='c007'>By statute 27 Geo. III., c. 1, the jurisdiction of justices
of the peace in the matter of lotteries was curtailed, but in
the case of <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Liston</i><a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c015'><sup>[319]</sup></a> it was held that their jurisdiction
was only taken away in the case of State lotteries.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Tuddenham</i>,<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c015'><sup>[320]</sup></a> it was held that whatever may
have been the effect of 27 Geo. III., c. 1, on which
<i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Liston</i> was decided, at any rate, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>46 Geo. III.,
c. 48.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
since 46 George III.,
c. 48, s. 59, all proceedings for the recovery of penalties
under 42 George III., c. 119, must be taken in the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the Attorney-General and not before magistrates, whether in
the case of a State lottery or otherwise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Newspaper proprietors.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 8 and 9 Vict., c. 74, all proceedings against newspaper
proprietors, &#38;c., for publishing advertisements relating
to lotteries, must also be taken in the name of the Attorney-General.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rogue and vagabond.</div>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The third alternative, which, perhaps, is the proceeding
most likely to be adopted in ordinary cases as being the
least cumbrous, is to prosecute the offender as a rogue and
vagabond under 42 George III., c. 119, s. 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, it is within the
discretion of magistrates to inflict a fine in lieu of imprisonment
on persons convicted as rogues and vagabonds. In
<i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Smetten</i>,<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c015'><sup>[321]</sup></a> where the magistrates had convicted the
defendant and fined him 20s., the Court intimated a doubt
as to whether the conviction was properly made. “The
form of the conviction is not before us. If the appellant
was convicted as a rogue and vagabond, and the justices
imposed a fine of 20s. in lieu of imprisonment, as they are
entitled to do under 42 and 43 Vict., c. 49, s. 4, then we think
the conviction was right. If, however, without convicting
him as a rogue and vagabond, they simply convicted him of
keeping a lottery, and fined him 20s. for so doing, under 42
George III., c. 119, s. 2, then we think the Statute 46 George
III., c. 148, s. 59 (3), applies, and the conviction could not
be upheld.” <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Tuddenham</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>This proceeding, however could not be applicable as
against the adventurers in a lottery: it is only available
against persons setting up or keeping the lottery, employing
others to do so, or aiding and abetting (42 Geo. III.,
c. 119, s. 4) others in doing so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The powers conferred by section 4 on justices to grant
warrants, etc., have already been set out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 6. Offenders may be apprehended on the spot
by any person and carried before a justice of the peace.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Art Unions</div>

<p class='c007'>A special exception has been made by statute in favour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>art unions, or associations formed for distributing works of
art by lot, a method of proceeding which would be probably
held to infringe the Lottery Acts were it not for the fact
that they are legalised by 9 &#38; 10 Vict., c. 48. This Act
provides that all voluntary associations constituted for the
distribution of works of art by lot are to be deemed lawful
associations, and the members and subscribers freed from all
penalties under the Lottery Acts. Provided that Royal
Charter be first obtained for the incorporation of such association,
and the instrument constituting such association,
together with its rules and regulations, be approved by the
Privy Council.</p>

<p class='c007'>By 18 Geo. II., c. 34, s. 7, no privilege of Parliament can

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c013'>GAMING HOUSES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>In Bacon’s Abridgment (title “Gaming”) it is stated “that
by the Common Law the playing at cards, dice, etc., when
innocently practised, and as a recreation the better to fit a
person for business, is not at all unlawful; yet if a person be
guilty of cheating, as by playing with false cards, dice, &#38;c.,
he may be indicted for it at Common Law and fined and imprisoned.
So, also a common player at hazard and using
false dice may be indicted for it at Common Law and set
in the pillory. An information against a person using the
game of cock-fighting may be at Common Law. Also all
common gaming houses are nuisances in the eye of the law;
not only because they are great temptations to idleness, but
also because they are apt to draw together great numbers of
disorderly persons, which cannot but be very inconvenient to
the neighbourhood.” Instances are then given of cases in
which the Courts have relieved against liabilities incurred by
excessive gaming.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown, Book I., cap. 75, section
6, it is said: “all common gaming houses are nuisances
in the eye of the law; not only because they are great temptations
to idleness, but because they draw together great
numbers of disorderly persons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Blackstone (vol. iv.) who classifies gamblers as (1) those
who are led into it by passion, (2) those who play from a
greed of gain, (3) those who are drawn into it by their surrounding,
states the legal objections to gambling as tending
to promote idleness and debauchery among the lower classes
and among the upper classes frequently attended with ruin
and desolation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>It is clear from this statement that the essence of illegality
at Common Law was fraud and excess, and that all establishments
which were kept for gaming purposes necessarily led
to excess. This being so, it would seem that in point of principle,
the Statutes 16 Charles II. and Anne and 18 Geo. II.,
of which mention has been made in Chapter I. of this work
was only declaratory of the Common Law, seeing that they
only dealt with fraudulent and excessive gaming, though no
doubt they laid down particular tests which did not exist
before, as to what should constitute excessive gaming.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gaming houses illegal at Common Law.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Rogiere</i><a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c015'><sup>[322]</sup></a> defendants were indicted “for that
they did unlawfully keep and maintain a certain gaming
house, and in the said common gaming house did cause and
procure divers idle and ill-disposed persons to frequent and
come to play together at a certain unlawful game called
<i><span lang="fr">Rouge et Noir</span></i>, for divers large and excessive sums of money.”
The Court held that the keeping a house of this description
was an offence at Common Law—<span class='sc'>Holroyd, J.</span>, adding that
in his opinion it would have been sufficient merely to have
alleged that the defendants kept a common gaming house,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>25 Geo. II.,
c. 36, sec. 5.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Statute 25 George II., c. 36, s. 5, confirmed this view of
the Common Law; for after reciting the prevalence of disorderly
houses, enacts, that to encourage prosecutions against
persons keeping gaming houses, &#38;c., it should be lawful for
any constable, upon information from two inhabitants of the
district, to take proceedings as therein specified. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>2 &#38; 3 Vict.,
c. 47, sec. 48.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Finally,
in 2 &#38; 3 Vict., c. 47, s. 48, we find an enactment that the
Commissioners of Police in the Metropolis may authorise
constables to enter houses suspected of being used as common
gaming houses and arrest persons found therein. <i>Provided</i>
that nothing should prevent the prosecution by indictment
of any person having the care or management of any gaming
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both these statutes clearly regard the keeping a gaming
house as an indictable offence; both prescribe certain
methods of procedure; one even goes so far as expressly to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>preserve the Common Law remedy. It is, however, remarkable
that in none of the writers or cases is any definition
of a common gaming house attempted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Test of a gaming house.</div>

<p class='c007'>It seems, however, clear from the dicta of text writers
just quoted and also from late authorities that any house
where a number of people habitually congregate for gaming
purposes where the play was excessive, either in the sense
of being ruinous, or as tending to become a sole absorbing
interest to the players and to distract them from the
ordinary business of life, or where the gaming led to
turbulence and disorder, such house, even if in form a
mere ordinary social club, would be a common gaming
house.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gaming.</div>

<p class='c007'>It seems now to be settled that to constitute gaming at
all there must be either playing some unlawful game or
playing a game, whether of skill or chance, for money.
<i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Ashton</i>, 1 E. and B. 286, <i>Dyson</i> v. <i>Mason</i>, 22
Q. B. D. 351.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Houses for unlawful games.</div>

<p class='c007'>There is also a series of statutes dealing with houses
kept for playing unlawful games.<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c015'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, 33 Henry VIII., c. 9, prohibited the keeping of
any common house or place of dicing table or carding, or
any other manner of game then prohibited or thereafter to
be invented. 13 George II., c. 19, s. 9, inflicts penalties on
any person keeping any office, table, or place for the games
of passage or games with dice, except backgammon.
18 George II., c. 34, prohibits the keeping of any house,
room, or playing roulet, or roly-poly, or any game with
cards or dice already prohibited by law. It is stated in
Hawkins (Pleas of the Crown, I. 725) that these statutes
did not aim at occasional gaming for recreation at an inn
which was not kept for the purpose. The games, too,
were only unlawful <i><span lang="la">sub modo</span></i>, and were not prohibited in a
man’s private grounds. Finally, there are the provisions
against keeping houses for lotteries, the principal statute on
this subject being 42 George III., c. 119, which, as has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>shown above, makes it penal to keep any “office or place”
for “Littlegoes.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Unlawful games.</div>

<p class='c007'>In some few cases particular games have been declared
unlawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the Statute 12 Richard II., c. 6, made tennis, football,
quoits, dice, unlawful when played by artificers and
labourers. But this Statute was repealed by Statute 21
Jas. I. Section 16, of 33 Henry VIII., prohibited the same
games with the addition of cards, dice, talles, and bowls, to
labourers and mariners or any serving man.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>18 Geo. II., c. 34.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 2 George II., c. 28, power is given to justices to
commit all persons to prison found playing at any unlawful
game.</p>

<p class='c007'>12 George II., c. 28, s. 2, made the games of faro, ace of
hearts, basket and hazard, illegal as lotteries, inflicted the
same penalties as for setting up a lottery, and £50 on the
players.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Statutes 13 George II., c. 19, and 18 George II.,
c. 34, in adding other games to the list, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Players.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
expressly imposed
the same penalties on the players or adventurers in the
games prohibited.<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c015'><sup>[324]</sup></a> As has been suggested above, in dealing
with these matters under the head of lotteries, to which
they more properly belong, it is difficult to escape the
conclusion that persons playing a friendly game of roulette
in a private house or a club would be liable under these
statutes, although by 46 George III., c. 148, proceedings
must be taken in the name of the Attorney-General.
From the recent decision in the case of <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i>,<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c015'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
that any which is a game of chance or of chance and skill
combined is now an unlawful game, if not in the sense
of being penal, at any rate so as to make it unlawful to
keep a house for the purpose of such games. There would
then seem to be three legal consequences of a game being
unlawful;</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) Where the statute inflicts a penalty;</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) A house kept for the purpose is constructively a
common gaming house or <i><span lang="la">primâ facie</span></i> evidence of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>(3) No prize to be awarded to the winner can be
recovered, as we saw when we were discussing section 18 of
8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these three subjects, keeping gaming houses, keeping
houses for unlawful games, and playing at unlawful games,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
were in some measure dealt with by the important Statute
8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, by s. 18 of which, it will be remembered,
all wagers were declared void. This statute now forms the
basis of the modern legislation on the subject of gaming
houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 1 of this Act repeals so much of the Statute of
Henry VIII. as declared any game of mere skill to be an
unlawful game.<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c015'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to gaming houses, &#38;c., it deprives noblemen
of the power of granting licenses to their servants for keeping
a common gaming house or playing any unlawful games.
With respect to the distinction which seemed to exist between
keeping a common gaming house and keeping a house for
unlawful games, it is clear that the two offences are by this
statute brought under one category. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sec. 2.
Evidence of a
gaming
house.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For section 2, after
reciting that doubts had been expressed whether houses open
to subscribers only were common gaming houses, enacts
that in default of other evidence proving any house to be a
common gaming house, it shall be sufficient in support of
any indictment or information to prove: (1) That the house
or place is kept or used for playing therein any unlawful
game. (2) That a bank is kept there by some of the players
exclusively of the others. (3) That the chances of any game
played therein are not alike favourable to all the players.</p>

<p class='c007'>So that by this enactment a house kept or used for
playing unlawful games is placed on the same footing
as a common gaming house, and the owner or manager
punishable accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 4 of the Act a penalty of £100 or six months’
imprisonment is inflicted on the owner or keeper of every
common gaming house, or the person having the care or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>management thereof, and also every banker, croupier, and
other person conducting the business of any common gaming
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sections 10 to 13 relate to the granting of billiard licenses—it
having always been doubtful whether billiards were
within the Statute of Henry VIII.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Statute 17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38, is the next statute on
the subject of gaming houses, and in addition to some
stringent provisions designed to prevent the Act 1845
being evaded or rendered a nullity, it introduces an offence
termed “keeping a house for unlawful gaming,” for which
a penalty of £500 is inflicted.</p>

<p class='c007'>After reciting the powers given to justices out of the
Metropolis, and to the Commissioners of Police within the
Metropolitan District by 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, and reciting
that keepers of gaming houses contrive by fortifying the
entrances to keep officers out of the houses until the instruments
of gaming have been removed, provides:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 1, that any person who shall obstruct any officer
authorised by the Act 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, to enter a gaming
house, or who, by any bolt, bar, or chain, or other contrivance
shall secure any external door or internal door of, or
means of access to any house, room or place, so authorised
to be entered, or shall by any other contrivance obstruct the
entry authorised as aforesaid to, of any constable or officer,
shall be liable to a penalty of £100, or in the discretion of
the Court to be imprisoned with or without hard labour for
six months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3 imposes a penalty of £50 or three months’ imprisonment,
on any person found in gaming houses by
officers entering as aforesaid, and refusing to give his name
and address, or giving a false name and address.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 4. Any person being the owner or occupier of
any house, room, or place, or having the use of the same,
who shall open, keep or use the same for the purpose of
unlawful gaming being carried on therein; and any person
being the owner or occupier of any house or room, shall
knowingly and wilfully permit the same to be opened, kept,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>or used by any other person for the purpose aforesaid, and
any person having the care or management of, or in any
manner assisting in conducting the business of any house,
room or place kept or used for the purposes aforesaid, and
any person who shall advance or furnish money for the
purpose of gaming with persons resorting thereto, is liable
to a penalty of £500 or twelve months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a summary of the different offences
respecting <i>Gaming Homes</i>:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Offences under the Gaming House Acts.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Being the owner or keeper of a common gaming house
or permitting a house to be so used.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Having the care or management or conducting the
business of the same as to what comes under this provision.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 4 of the earlier Act expressly mentions the banker
or croupier of such a house. It is presumed that the decision
in <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Cook</i>,<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c015'><sup>[327]</sup></a> which arose under the Betting House Act
(see <i>post</i>), would apply to this section, viz., that the law
only extends to persons taking a share in the illegal part
of the business.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i> the committee in whom, by the Rules
of the Club, the management of the club was vested, were
held liable as managers.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Obstructing officers authorised to enter a house under
the provisions of section 3 or section 6 of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109—penalty
£100 or six months’ imprisonment, section 1 of
17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4.) Any person found in a gaming house by officers
entering under the above power, and giving a false name
and address or refusing to give his name and address, is
liable to a penalty of £50 or three months.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What constitutes a gaming house.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is now necessary to inquire what constitutes a common
gaming house within these Acts. It must, however, be
remembered that persons may be brought within the above
provisions concerning resisting officers and giving false
names and addresses, even though it may turn out that a
particular house be not eventually proved to come within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Acts. The officer’s justification for entry is the magistrate’s
warrant, or in the metropolis the direction of the commissioners.
So that the owners of a house could not justify any
resistance to constables who enter by virtue of the Act, by
proving that the house is not a gaming house.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c015'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The question as to the evidence necessary to prove
that a house is a gaming house, is partly answered by the
statutes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evidence.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus, section 2 of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, after reciting that
doubts had arisen whether houses open to subscribers only
were common gaming houses, provides that in default of
other evidence it shall be sufficient to prove—(1) That the
house or place is kept or used for the purpose of playing
therein any unlawful game. The subject, Unlawful Games,
has been treated above, page 152. (2) That a bank is kept
there by some of the players exclusively of the others.
(3) That the chances of any game played therein are not
alike favourable to all the players.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 8, where any cards, dice, balls, counters,
tables, or other instruments of gaming used in playing any
unlawful game shall be found in any house, room, or place
suspected to be used for a common gaming house, and
entered under a warrant or order issued under the provisions
of this Act,<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c015'><sup>[329]</sup></a> or about the persons of those who shall
be found therein, it shall be evidence until the contrary
appears, that such house, room or place is used as a common
gaming house, <i>and</i> that the persons found therein were
playing therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>By 17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38, s. 2, where any constable
authorised under 8 &#38; 9 Vict. to enter any house, &#38;c., is
wilfully prevented, or obstructed, or delayed in entering in
the manner specified, or where any external or internal
door of or access to any such house, &#38;c., is found fitted or
provided with any bolt, bar, chain, or other means of contrivance
for the purpose of obstructing such officers, or for
giving an alarm in case of such entry, or if such house is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>found provided with any means or contrivance for unlawful
gaming, or for concealing, removing, or destroying any
instrument of gaming, it shall be evidence, until the contrary
be made to appear, that such house is used as a common
gaming house.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c015'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Private houses.</div>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered that a club or private house may
equally be a common gaming house as a public place of
resort. This is clear from the recitals of section 2 just
quoted. The matter is also put beyond all doubt by the
late case of <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i>,<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c015'><sup>[331]</sup></a> where Mr. Justice <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>
says that to hold otherwise would lead to evasion by placing
a wide limit on the numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would appear, also, from the same case that a house or
club might still be a common gaming house, if it were kept
for the double purpose of social pursuits and gaming, if
gaming were one of the objects for which the club was
formed, or a house kept open. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Excessive
gaming
evidence.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is also expressly laid down
that excessive gaming is evidence that a house is a common
gaming house. Mr. Justice <span class='sc'>Smith</span> considering that excessive
gaming was unlawful in itself, in spite of the repeal of
the provisions of the Act of Anne, and section 8 of 18
George II.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Keeping a house for public billiards.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 11 of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, any person keeping
a house or place for public billiards without a license, or
without a victualler’s license for the house, and without the
words “licensed for billiards” written outside, is liable to be
proceeded against as the keeper of a common gaming house.</p>

<p class='c007'>In section 4 of the Act of 1854 we find, if not a new
offence, at any rate a new phraseology. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Keeping a
house for
unlawful
gaming.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The offence there
spoken of is not keeping a common gaming house but
keeping a house “for unlawful gaming.” What unlawful
gaming consists in is not defined: the Legislature evidently
supposing that the terms had already received judicial
interpretation. The Act of 1845 and the previous sections
of the statutes seemed to refer to common gaming houses;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and it will be remembered that section 2 of the earlier Act
made the playing of any unlawful game in a house evidence
that the house was a common gaming house. It will be
seen that the term “unlawful gaming” has just received a
construction which places it on the footing of a generalization;
embracing the two species of offence, viz., playing
an unlawful game and keeping a gambling house. The
effect and meaning of the term “keeping a house for unlawful
gaming,” has of late been thoroughly discussed in the case
of <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks and others</i>,<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c015'><sup>[332]</sup></a> commonly known as the
Park Club case. Jenks, the defendant in the Court below,
was the proprietor of a club house in Park Place, St. James’,
managed by a committee of four members, by whom the
other members were elected. The subscribers were 270
in number, each paying a yearly subscription. By the
rules of the club hazard and games with dice were forbidden,
and points at whist were not to exceed £1. All games were
to be played for ready money. It was proved by the night
steward of the club that a game called baccarat was played
nightly among the members. That play commenced at
4.30 p.m., and continued until 7.30, and began again at
10.30 and lasted till 3 or even 8 a.m. Baccarat is a fair
game among the players, the chances being equal; it is a
game both of skill and chance, but chiefly of chance, and
there are no advantages to be derived except from skill or
luck. It is played with three packs of cards, and banks are
formed varying in amount from £50 to £1,000, the whole
of which might be lost or won in about twenty minutes. It
was from these banks that the profits of the proprietor,
calculated to amount to at least £10,000 a year, were derived.
There were no other profits made in the club except the
banks; cigars and wine were sold at cost price; the kitchen
was carried on at a loss; the subscriptions were barely
enough to meet the club expenses. The number of members
was limited to 500. The proprietor, the members of the
committee, and some of the players were summoned before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Sir <span class='sc'>James Ingham</span>, at the Bow Street Police Court<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c015'><sup>[333]</sup></a> for
keeping a house for unlawful gaming, and were all convicted
in penalties of varying amounts.</p>

<p class='c007'>These convictions were affirmed in the Divisional Court,
except in the case of the players. <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, in giving
judgment, said that the real question was whether this
house was kept for the purpose of unlawful gaming. There
could be no question that gaming was the chief object of the
club. The social arrangements were quite ancillary to the
gaming purposes. The club rules against gambling, though
admirable on the face of them, were really intended to
conceal the real objects of the club. Even if it had been a
<i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> social club, for the double purpose of society and
gaming, it would still be within the statute as a house
opened and kept for unlawful gaming, provided the gaming
that took place were unlawful. The Statute 17 &#38; 18 Vict.,
c. 38, is not directed against a person who merely keeps a
gaming house; it imposes penalties on persons who open or
keep a house for the purpose of unlawful gaming, and those
who assist in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question then really is whether the gaming for which
the house was opened was unlawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The magistrate put the matter on too narrow a footing in
treating it solely as a question whether the games themselves
were unlawful; whereas the statute is directed against
unlawful gaming, and not merely against unlawful games.
Gaming may be unlawful (1) by reason of the place wherein
it is played; (2) by reason of the unlawfulness of the game
itself. Now, cards are not unlawful, either at Common Law
or by statute;<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c015'><sup>[334]</sup></a> but it is illegal to keep a common gaming
house, and if cards were played therein that gaming would
be unlawful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two questions therefore arise: (1) Was this a common
gambling house? (2) Is baccarat an unlawful game?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>(1.) There could be no doubt that this was a common
gaming house, and its practices were of the pernicious
tendency alluded to by the different law writers and by the
judges in <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Rogiere</i>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Club.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is immaterial that the numbers
of the club were limited; all gaming houses are; and
if you allow a limit of 500, why not of 5,000? (2) As
to the illegality of the game, the statutes, with very few
exceptions, do not declare any games to be unlawful except
when played by particular persons or in particular places.
The earliest of the statutes was 33 Henry VIII., which
prohibited any common house or alley being kept for the
purpose of cards, or dicing, or any unlawful game then
known or thereafter to be invented.<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c015'><sup>[335]</sup></a> Some of the provisions
of this statute, so far as they affected “games of skill,” were
repealed. The test, therefore, seems to be whether a game
be one purely of skill or not. Baccarat, therefore, being
a game both of chance and skill, must be held to be an
unlawful game.<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c015'><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Statutes of Anne and 18 George II., section 8, which
laid down tests as to what was excessive gaming (by the
former the loss or gain of £10 at one time or sitting, by the
latter £10 at one time and £20 within twenty-four hours)
were repealed by 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, section 15, consequently
excessive playing is no longer the test of illegality, but it
may be some evidence of a house being used as a common
gaming house. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The
Committee.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His lordship held that the committee were
liable for taking part in the management of the club.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The players.</div>

<p class='c007'>The conviction against the players could not be sustained,
though they might have been convicted of playing at unlawful
games, but his lordship reserved this question. The
words of the statute, “use the same for the purpose of
unlawful gaming being carried on there,” only applies to
a licensee to carry on the business.</p>

<p class='c007'>A. L. Smith, J., delivered a judgment to the same effect,
differing from Hawkins, J., only in one point, viz., as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>excessiveness making a game unlawful. He considered
that the dicta in Bacon and <i>R.</i> v. <i>Rogiere</i> were still good
law, although the particular statutory limits of legality had
been repealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that if the decision in this case were pushed
to its utmost limits the law might be enforced in cases where
games, though technically “unlawful,” were merely made
the means of innocent recreation. It is not difficult to suppose
cases in which a club, though it could not possibly be
called a common gaming house, might still be, according to
the strict letter of the law, a house kept for unlawful
gaming, if a game, not being a game exclusively of skill—say,
for example, whist—were one of the objects for which
a club was formed. But this is only one out of many applications
of the saying, “<i><span lang="la">Summum jus, summa injuria</span></i>.” The
case of gaming houses presents no greater absurdity than
the law of larceny, according to which the housemaid who
abstracts a pin from her mistress’s pincushion is liable to
the same punishment as a clerk who robs his master’s till.
In the same way any person who gets up an ordinary sweepstakes
for the Derby at a club brings himself in strictness
within the Lottery Acts; but probably no magistrate would
convict such person as a rogue and vagabond, as he might
do under the statutes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Players.</div>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the players either in gaming houses or at
unlawful games, the penal or restrictive provisions of the
statutes are neither numerous nor stringent. 12 Rich. II.,
c. 6, forbad servants, labourers, apprentices, and artificers
to play football or dice, but this was repealed by 21 James I.,
c. 28. 33 Henry VIII., c. 9, s. 16, forbad artificers and
labourers to play at the tables, tennis, dice or bowls out of
Christmas under a penalty of 20s. This section does not
appear to have been totally repealed, except by 8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109, s. 1, so far as games of skill are concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above provisions seem to have been directed against
<i>particular classes</i> of persons. With respect to <i>persons found
playing</i> in gaming houses, 33 Henry VIII., c. 9, s. 12,
imposed a penalty of 6s. 8d. upon them, and s. 14 empowered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>justices to enter such houses to arrest the persons “there
haunting, resorting, and playing,” and bind them over in
recognisances with or without sureties. By 2 George II.,
c. 88, s. 9, this jurisdiction is extended to cases proved by
two credible witnesses.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to <i>excessive gaming</i>, the penal provisions contained in
16 Car. II., c. 7, 9 Anne, c. 14, and 18 George II., c. 34,
s. 8, imposing penalties for winning over a specified sum
within a given time, are repealed by 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109,
s. 15. In <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i>,<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c015'><sup>[337]</sup></a> it was held that the players
could not be convicted for assisting in the management or
business of the house (see <i>ante</i> p. 160.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases <i>particular games</i> have been prohibited under
penalties; see <i>ante</i> at the commencement of the chapter on
Lotteries, where these provisions are summarised. It will be
observed that the particular game is always specified, there
is no general prohibition against games of cards or chance;
and the game is in each case prohibited <i>as a lottery</i>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lending money for gaming purposes.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is only necessary to mention very shortly another
offence constituted by section 4 of the same Act, viz.,
advancing or furnishing money for the purposes of such unlawful
gaming, which is visited with the same penalty of
£500. Of course the money so advanced cannot be recovered
(see <i>ante</i> p. 16.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Illegal partnerships.</div>

<p class='c007'>With respect to partnership in gaming houses, it would
seem to be clear on principle that one partner cannot sue
another, nor can a principal sue an agent for an account of
moneys won in an illegal adventure. The test adopted in
<i>Simpson</i> v. <i>Bloss</i><a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c015'><sup>[338]</sup></a> seems to make this clear, viz., does the
plaintiff require any aid from the illegal bargain to establish
his case?</p>

<p class='c007'>In case of the partnership in a gaming house, the contract
which would have to be proved contemplates the establishment
of an illegal gaming house. The case of <i>Sharpe</i> v.
<i>Taylor</i><a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c015'><sup>[339]</sup></a> seems rather to conflict with this view. It was an
action by one co-owner of a vessel against the other to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>recover a share of the profits earned by the vessel. The
vessel was registered in the name of “A,” an American
citizen, which seems to have been a breach either of the
laws of the United States or of the English navigation
laws, as carrying on trade between the two countries, without
the real owners of the vessel being registered as
such.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord <span class='sc'>Cottenham</span> held that the plea of illegality of the
adventure was no answer. Some of the dicta of his lordship’s
judgment, pp. 817, 818, seem to countenance the
view that a partner or an agent cannot set up illegality as
a defence to the claim of a co-partner or principal, so long
as the illegal part of the transaction is closed. Possibly,
however, the decision can be supported on the ground that
the object of the adventure was perfectly legal, viz., the
importation of American produce in an English ship, though
incidentally the provisions of the English navigation laws
were not complied with.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be admitted that in <i>Bridger</i> v. <i>Savage</i><a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c015'><sup>[340]</sup></a> the Court
quoted the dicta of Lord Cottenham with approval concerning
the plea of illegality, but that case cannot be considered an
authority on the point, as the transaction had relation to
betting, and not to any illegal contract. In <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>Beadon</i><a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c015'><sup>[341]</sup></a>
<span class='sc'>Jessel, M.R.</span> refers to Lord Cottenham’s dicta with disapproval.
At p. 195, “The notion that because a transaction
which is illegal is closed, that therefore a Court of Equity is to
interfere in dividing the proceeds of the illegal transaction,
is not only opposed to principle but to authority; to authority
in the well-known case of the highwaymen, where a
robbery had been committed and one of the highwaymen
unsuccessfully sued the other for a division of the proceeds
of the robbery.” At p. 196: “It is not sufficient to say
that the transaction is concluded as a reason for the interference
of the Court. If that were the reason it would be
lending the aid of the Court to assert the rights of the
parties in carrying out and completing an illegal contract.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>If the contract is for the purpose of smuggling, that is an
illegal contract, and the Court cannot maintain it, and the
Court will not lend its aid to it at all. In my own practice
a case occurred in which one of the partners in a gaming
house sued the other partner for an account of profits. It
did not come on for hearing, because the plaintiff thought
better of it, and I am satisfied the bill could not have been
maintained; still the assertion of the bill was that the
gaming house had been closed, and the plaintiff asked for
an account on that footing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The dicta of the Master of the Rolls have the support of
a judgment of Lord <span class='sc'>Denman</span> in <i>Mortimer</i> v. <i>MacCallan</i>,<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c015'><sup>[342]</sup></a>
where <i>Simpson</i> v. <i>Bloss</i> was quoted with approval. “This
was in fact a partnership in the profits of an illegal adventure;
if the plaintiff had received the whole the defendant
could not have recovered his share.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Illegality cannot be set up by third party.</div>

<p class='c007'>At the same time a person who has received money
payable under an illegal contract, not himself being a party
to the contract, cannot plead the illegality. <i>Tennant</i> v.
<i>Elliott</i><a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c015'><sup>[343]</sup></a> and <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Farmer</i><a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c015'><sup>[344]</sup></a> were both cases of this kind.
This was the view taken of them by Jessel, M. R., in <i>Sykes</i>
v. <i>Beadon</i>,<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c015'><sup>[345]</sup></a> and by Crampton, J., in <i>Nicholson</i> v. <i>Gooch</i>.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c015'><sup>[346]</sup></a>
Therefore if the partners in a gaming house kept a banking
account, it is clear that the banker could be sued for the money.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Agent or Manager.</div>

<p class='c007'>The same, it is submitted, applies to the case of an agent
or manager of such an establishment: he certainly could
not sue his principal for reimbursement or salary, <i>Thacker</i> v.
<i>Hardy</i>,<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c015'><sup>[347]</sup></a> so it is difficult to see why the principal should have
a right to an account against his agent for profits. Nearly
all cases where <i>Sharp</i> v. <i>Taylor</i> has been approved the real
question did not arise, as they were in many cases like
<i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Lansley</i>,<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c015'><sup>[348]</sup></a> adventures in betting transactions which
are not illegal: this matter is dealt with <i>post</i> p. 191.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cheating at play.</div>

<p class='c007'>Another offence besides keeping a gaming house dealt
with by this statute is cheating at play. By section 17,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Every person who shall by any fraud or unlawful device or
ill practice in playing at or with cards, dice, tables, or other
game, or in bearing a part in the stakes, wagers or adventures,
or in betting on the sides or hands of them that do
play, or in wagering on the event of any game, sport, or
pastime, win from any other person to himself or any other
or others any sum of money or valuable thing, shall be
deemed guilty of obtaining such money, &#38;c., by a false
pretence, and punished accordingly.” In <i>Regina</i> v. <i>O’Connor</i><a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c015'><sup>[349]</sup></a>
it was held that where persons fraudulently won from
another certain property by tossing with coins, that was a
“pastime” within the Act if it was not a “game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As to conspiracy to defraud by the means mentioned in
this section, see <i>Regina</i> v. <i>Hudson</i>.<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c015'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Games.</div>

<p class='c007'>There can be no doubt that horse-racing is a “game”
within the meaning of this section as it was within the
Statute of Anne (<i>sup.</i> Cap. I., Part I). It would seem that
the offence of winning is complete directly the event is
declared in favour of the person who is guilty of the fraud,
before the money is actually paid over.<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c015'><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Privilege of Parliament.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 18 Geo. II., c. 34, s. 7, no privilege of Parliament can
be pleaded to a charge of keeping a gaming house.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BETTING HOUSES.</h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119.</div>

<p class='c007'>16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119, after reciting that numerous
establishments had been set up for betting houses and
for taking money in advance on promises to pay on
the events of horse-races. Section 1 enacts: “That
no office, house, room, or other place shall be opened,
kept, or used for the purpose of the owner, occupier,
or keeper thereof, or any person using the same, or any
person procured or employed by or acting for or on behalf
of such owner, occupier, or keeper or person using the same,
or if any person having the care or management or in any
manner conducting the business thereof, betting with persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>resorting thereto: or for the purpose of any money or
valuable thing being received by or on behalf of such owner,
occupier, keeper, or person as aforesaid as or for the consideration
for any assurance, undertaking, promise, or agreement,
express or implied, to pay or give thereafter any money
or valuable thing on any event or contingency of or relating
to any horse-race or race, fight, game, sport, or exercise, or
on the consideration for securing the payment or giving by
some other person of any money or valuable thing on such
events as aforesaid.” Every such house, &#38;c., is declared to
be a common nuisance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 2. All such houses, &#38;c., are declared common
gaming houses within 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3. Any person who, being the owner or occupier of
any office, house, room or other place, or a person using the
same, shall open, keep or use the same for the purposes hereinbefore
mentioned or either of them, <i>or</i> being the owner or
occupier shall permit the same to be so used, <i>and</i> any person
having the care or management of or in any manner assisting
in conducting any such house or place kept for the
purposes aforesaid, is liable to a penalty of £100 or six
months’ imprisonment with or without hard labour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Section 4. Receiving money on deposit for a bet.</div>

<p class='c007'>By Section 4 any person being the owner or occupier of
any office, house, room or place opened, kept or used for the
purpose aforesaid or either of them, <i>or</i> any person acting on
behalf of such owner or occupier, <i>or</i> any person having the
care or management or in any manner assisting or conducting
the business thereof, who shall receive directly or indirectly
any money or valuable thing or a deposit on any bet on
condition of paying any sum of money or other valuable
thing on the happening of any event or contingency of
or relating to a horse-race or any other race, or any fight,
game, sport, or exercise, or as the consideration for any
agreement to give any money or valuable thing on such
event, and any person giving any acknowledgment, note or
security on the receipt of any such deposit is liable to a
penalty of £50 or three months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c007'>By Section 5 any money or valuable thing received by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>any such person as aforesaid as a deposit in any bet or as or
for the consideration for any such assurance, &#38;c., as
aforesaid, shall be deemed to have been received to and for
the use of the person from whom the same was received,
and such money or valuable thing or the value thereof may
be recovered accordingly. See <i>ante</i> p. 65, where this section
is fully considered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Exception in favour of a prize to the winner of a race.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 6. Nothing in this Act is to extend to any person
receiving any money or valuable thing by way of stakes or
deposit to be paid to the winner of any race, sport or
exercise, or to the owner of any horse engaged in any race—an
exception which seems very analogous to the proviso of
section 18 of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, exempting “contributions
to a prize” from the general law with respect to wagers,
which has been discussed above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Betting houses.</div>

<p class='c007'>With respect to this statute against betting houses the
following are the offences specified:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Summary of offences.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Being the owner or occupier of a house or place kept
or used (<i>a</i>) for the purpose of betting with persons resorting
thereto (<i>b</i>) for the purpose of receiving money on deposit in
respect of bets.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Using any such house for such purposes or either of
them or permitting such user.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Having the care and management or assisting in the
business of any such house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above persons are each liable to a penalty of £100 or
six months’ imprisonment. They are, in addition, liable to
be indicted for a nuisance, seeing that such houses are
declared to be, by section 1, common nuisances; by section
2, gaming houses within 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Receiving deposits.</div>

<p class='c007'>(4.) By section 4, all the above persons (<i>i.e.</i>, the owner
or occupier of such house or place, or any person acting
on his behalf, or any person having the care or management
or assisting in conducting the business) are liable to a
penalty of £50 or three months for receiving money or
other valuable thing as a deposit on a bet<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c015'><sup>[352]</sup></a> and by section 5
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the depositor may recover the money deposited as money
paid to his use. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Exception in
favour of
prize.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But section 6 contains an exception in
favour of any stakes or deposit to be paid to a winner of a
race, or the owner of a horse that is running. It is not very
easy to see what the practical effect is of providing that betting
houses shall come within the meaning of common gaming
houses in 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>? Effect of
sec. 2.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the enactments in section 2
of the latter Act, are such as could not apply to a house
merely kept for betting purposes, while 16 &#38; 17 Vict. itself
declares betting houses to be common nuisances, inflicts a
specific penalty for keeping them, and contains provisions
for entering and searching them.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5.) Another species of offence prohibited by this Act is
advertising houses or places as being opened or used for
the particular kind of betting prohibited by the Act. This
is by virtue of section 7, the provisions of which, as will
appear more fully hereafter, are supplemented by a later
statute, 37 Vict., c. 15.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cases under the Betting House Act. Secs. 1 and 3.</div>

<p class='c007'>The questions and cases which have arisen and been
decided under the Act of 1853, may be grouped under the
following heads:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. What is a “place”?</p>

<p class='c007'>II. Persons liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. What kind of betting is within the Act.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is a “place”?</div>

<p class='c007'>I. The meaning of the term “place,” which is used in
the Acts directed against gaming and betting houses, as in
fact it is in all the previous statutes on the subject of houses
and “places” kept for the purposes of gaming or playing
unlawful games, has undergone a great deal of discussion.
It will be remembered that the Statute 4, George IV.,
c. 60, declared the term “place” as used in previous
statutes, particularly the Lottery Acts, to mean “a place in
or out of enclosed premises, whether on land or water.”
Even if this statute cannot be regarded strictly as interpretative
of all statutes, it may at any rate be a guide to
the meaning of the term in other statutes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>In <i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i><a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c015'><sup>[353]</sup></a> the action was brought to recover
money deposited with the defendant on a bet, under s. 5
of the Act (given in full above). The defendant was in
the habit of resorting to Hyde Park and keeping a betting
table. <i>Held</i>, that though it was not necessary that a
“place” should be under cover, still a spot in a public
park which could not have an owner or occupier, would not
come within the section. Per <span class='sc'>Pollock, C. B.</span>, on the
ground that a place to be within the Act must be capable
of having an owner or occupier. Per <span class='sc'>Bramwell</span>, on the
ground that it was not an ascertained place. Per <span class='sc'>Lush, J.</span>,
in <i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c015'><sup>[354]</sup></a> “the person there was not an
occupier of the place, and he had no business to use it for
that purpose.” In the course of the arguments, a remark
was made by <span class='sc'>Bramwell, B.</span>, that the table occupied by the
defendant could not be a common gaming house within
section 2. This seems to suggest that nothing could be a
place within the Act unless it could by a fair construction
be considered a gaming house.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Morley</i> v. <i>Greenhalge</i><a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c015'><sup>[355]</sup></a> was quoted in <span class='sc'>Lush, J.</span>,
in <i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c015'><sup>[356]</sup></a> as depending on the same principles
as <i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i>. It was held that a person could
not be convicted of keeping, using, or acting in the management
of any place for the purpose of cock-fighting, or of
suffering or permitting it to be so used (contrary to
12 &#38; 13 Vict., c. 92, section 3) who resorted to a quarry
of which he was not the owner or occupier, for the purpose
of aiding in a cock-fight. The owner of the quarry had
nothing to do with the men being there, and they had
no business there. It seems that in <i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i>
the Court took a different view of the ratio of the
decision in <i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i> to that taken by the judges
in <i>Bows</i> v. <i>Fenwick</i>,<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c015'><sup>[357]</sup></a> the former looked upon it as decided
on the ground that it was a public place, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>defendant had no business to use it for betting purposes.
The latter, rejecting the argument based on the fact that
a man “might be ordered to move on,” distinguished
<i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i>, as will be seen, on the ground that no
fixed place was used.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Morley</i><a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c015'><sup>[358]</sup></a> there was a space railed off near the
enclosure of a racecourse, about 44 yards by 2. It was let
out to a tenant who paid rent for it, and by him divided into
partitions; in each partition there was a wooden structure,
5 feet in height, fronting both ways, in which betting transactions
were conducted, but which had no roof. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Betting out
of towns.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was contended
for the defendant that these structures were not
offices or places within the Act, which was directed against
betting in towns, and the words “house” or “place” must
be <i><span lang="la">ejusdem generis</span></i> with the words “house” or “room.”
<i>Held</i>, that the Act was wide enough to cover betting out of
towns; that this was a place and an office within the Acts;
and that defendant was conducting a business within section
3. Per <span class='sc'>Kelly, C.B.</span>: “It is no matter whether there
is a roof or none, or whether the structure is moveable or
fastened to the earth.” Per <span class='sc'>Martin, B.</span>: “The structure
described was both an office and a place. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Moveable
offices.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What it most
resembles is those moveable offices on wheels, in which
merchants conduct their business of lading and unlading
ships in the docks of Liverpool, and I have no doubt that
such a structure would be an office or a place within the meaning
of the Act. But this was more, it was a fixed place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This case decides three points—(1) That the Act is wide
enough to reach betting in rural places; (2) That an uncovered
as well as a covered spot may be a place within
the Acts; (3) Any locomotive structure may also be a place.
But the judgment of Grove, J., in <i>Galloway</i> v. <i>Maries</i> (<i>post</i>)
should be compared with this.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>An umbrella may be a “place.”</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Bows</i> v. <i>Fenwick</i><a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c015'><sup>[359]</sup></a> an umbrella was held to be within
the Act. Defendant was on a racecourse, standing on a stool
which was covered by a large umbrella capable of covering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>several persons, the stock being made in joints like that of a
sweep’s brush, so as to be taken in pieces. On the umbrella
were written the defendant’s name and address. There was
also a card exhibited on which were the words, “We pay
all bets first past the post.” The umbrella was kept up
whether the weather was wet or dry. Numerous bets were
made by the defendant. It was argued that this case was
like <i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i>, the place which defendant occupied
being public, and that no erection could constitute a place
within the Act from which defendant could be ordered to
move on. The Court held that this was a place within the
Act. They considered it more like <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Morley</i> than
<i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i>. In the latter case there was no fixed
place within the park at which defendant was stationed.
Here, the card and the umbrella with the inscription clearly
indicated a fixed and ascertained place where the defendant
carried on a prohibited business.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Enclosures.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i><a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c015'><sup>[360]</sup></a> the defendant was in occupation of
a large enclosure of more than three acres, where a pigeon-shooting
match was going on. The Court held that the fact
of its being a large enclosure did not affect the question;
and that it was a place in spite of the fact that there was no
structure erected therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the case is more important on the question of
“user.” The same remark also applies to <i>Haigh</i> v. <i>Sheffield</i>,<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c015'><sup>[361]</sup></a>
which was another case of an enclosure used as a cricket
ground. It was again argued unsuccessfully, that “place”
meant something of the same nature as “office” or “house.”
But it may now be taken as settled that any kind of enclosure,
whether covered or not, with or without an erection,
may come within the Acts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A bookmaker on a stool in the grand stand.</div>

<p class='c007'>Finally, we come to the case of <i>Galloway</i> v. <i>Maries</i>,<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c015'><sup>[362]</sup></a> in
which the Court went a step further in curtailing the bookmaker’s
liberty of action on a racecourse.</p>

<p class='c007'>A race meeting was held in Four Oaks Park, belonging
to a company, admission being by payment. Defendant and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>another man A obtained entrance to a railed enclosure called
the ring, attached to the grand stand. A stood on a wooden
box not attached to the ground, and both he and defendant
offered to make bets with people about, A receiving the
money, and defendant entering the bets in his book. They
remained in one place the whole time. The Court held that
this was “a place” within the Act. The justices had submitted
for their consideration—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Questions submitted to Court.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Whether the enclosure was “a place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Whether the box was “a place.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Grove, J.</span>, said the questions were not well framed. “The
box, which is a moveable thing, cannot of itself be a place,
and perhaps the enclosure might not of itself be a place
within the Act. The real question is whether the facts in
the case constituted a ‘place.’” After referring to the previous
cases, continued: “I am inclined to think that the
more important consideration is the fixity of the place, not,
indeed, the absolute fixity as in the case of fixtures, but in
the sense of the place being and remaining the same for a
considerable time, long enough for the betting public to
know where persons willing and offering to bet might be
found. I do not say whether a person standing on a carriage
step or in a circle where the turf was cut away would
be within the Act, but I am far from saying he would not
be so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this case it may be observed—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) That from the remarks of Grove, J., about the frame
of the questions, the real issue is not whether a particular
structure or spot is “a place” or not, but whether,
coupled with all the facts, the use to which it has been
put, &#38;c., a place has not been constituted by the act of the
person.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) That the remark of Grove, J., as to the box not being
a place as being moveable, is in contradiction to the views
of Kelly, C.B., and Martin, B., in <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Morley</i> (<i><span lang="la">vide
supra</span></i>). In the latter case it was the certainty rather than
the fixity of the place that was taken as the test.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) It was the fact that the defendant occupied one spot
the whole of the time which formed the grounds of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>judgment. “There must be,” said <span class='sc'>Grove, J.</span>, at p. 211,
“a fixed, ascertained place occupied or used so far permanently
that people may know that there is a person who
stands in a particular spot, indicated by a certain definite
mark, with whom they may bet.” This case seems to show
that in order for a person to be within the Act, it is not
sufficient that he should be in an enclosure, say the grand
stand, at a racecourse and betting with people there, unless
he occupies one spot within the enclosure for the whole
time. <i>Snow</i> v. <i>Hill</i><a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c015'><sup>[363]</sup></a> the defendant was convicted by the
magistrates of an offence under the Act, it having been
proved that he was in a reserved part of the ground, and
was walking about making bets with people therein. The
Court held that the defendant was not within the Act. It
is, however, difficult to say from the judgment in this case
whether the decision was rested on the fact that he was
walking about and did not occupy one spot, or whether
sufficient user for the purpose of betting was not proved.
The judgments in <i>Whitehurst</i> v. <i>Fincher</i><a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c015'><sup>[364]</sup></a> and of Hawkins, J.,
in <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Preedie</i> (see next page note) seem to suggest that
the latter was the real ground of the case. It is submitted
that, after the case of <i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i> and <i>Hague</i> v.
<i>Sheffield</i>, an enclosure of the kind is such a place within the
Act as is capable of being used for the purpose of betting.
In the two latter cases it is true the owners were convicted
of permitting the places to be so used. They were not
prosecutions of the men using them. It would seem, however,
to be clear that the owner cannot be liable for permitting
such user unless the user itself is illegal under the
Act. The conclusion would therefore seem to be that the
owner cannot be liable unless the person using the same is
liable also, and in neither of these cases does it appear that
fixed spots were occupied and it was the whole enclosure and
not definite spots therein that were alleged to have been
so used. The observations of Hawkins, J., <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Cook</i><a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c015'><sup>[365]</sup></a>
seem to support this view. His lordship evidently considers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the ordinary operations of betting men in such enclosures
illegal, irrespective of their doing business on a stool or
under an umbrella. “Here was ample evidence that the
betting men were using these grounds for the purpose of
betting with all persons resorting thereto, but no proceedings
seem to have been taken against them.” But no doubt
the place alleged to be used must be so far limited in area
as not to be too large for the operations of the person using
it. A man could not be said to use Hyde Park for betting
purposes, though he might use a particular part of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Preedie</i>,<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c015'><sup>[366]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, in a judgment delivered
at the Central Criminal Court, which contains an elaborate
survey of the statute and the cases thereon, thus expresses
his views on this topic (after referring to <i>Galloway</i> v. <i>Maries</i>
and <i>Snow</i> v. <i>Hill</i>): “I can hardly think that the learned
judges intended to lay down as law that nothing would
satisfy the term ‘place’ unless it was some particular spot
in which a person stood, or which was appropriated by him
exclusively for his own use.... The place must
not be unlimited. On the contrary, I am of opinion that
though it may be bounded by no definite line, it must nevertheless
be limited in extent to the area occupied by the persons
congregating together and resorting to it: so that any
person carrying on his business there as a betting man might
fairly and reasonably be said to be doing so in the immediate
presence of those congregated together.” The Scotch
case of <i>Heuretty</i> v. <i>Hart</i><a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c015'><sup>[367]</sup></a> is quite in accord with this view;
it was there held that a racecourse of about twenty acres in
extent, though enclosed, could not of itself be a place.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the above state of the authorities, bookmakers in the
ring, say in the grand stand at a race meeting, must not
assume that they are outside the Act however much their
operations may be winked at by the authorities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A room.</div>

<p class='c007'>But where a room has been used no difficulty has been
felt. <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Preedie</i> (<i><span lang="la">ubi sup.</span></i>) was the case of the user of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>tap room of a public house. It was held that the fact that
the house or place was not primarily addicted to betting
purposes was immaterial; that actual user of the place was
sufficient.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Whitehurst</i> v. <i>Fincher</i><a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c015'><sup>[368]</sup></a> was a case of the user of a room,
but the Court did not think there was any evidence of
sufficient user for the illegal purpose, the person using
it was not a bookmaker. In the late case of <i>Hornsby</i> v.
<i>Raggett</i><a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c015'><sup>[369]</sup></a> the Court held that user of the room for the illegal
purpose was one of the offences specified in the Act, and it
was not necessary that the person using it should confine
himself to any one spot therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. Persons liable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Persons liable.</div>

<p class='c007'>(1.) The owner, keeper or occupier (A), using the premises
for the purpose of illegal betting, such as is described hereafter
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Permitting.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> (B), Permitting them to be so used; that is, if he connives
at what he knows will result in illegal practices; as
was said by Lord <span class='sc'>Blackburn</span> in <i>Haigh</i> v. <i>Sheffield</i>.<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c015'><sup>[370]</sup></a>...
“It is clear that the magistrate came to the conclusion
that the appellant knew that people resorted to the
enclosure for the purpose of betting, and permitted foot-racing
to go on and these betting men to come in, knowing
the betting to be an ordinary consequence. The magistrate
was right, therefore, in saying the appellant did permit the
place to be used for betting, on the principle that a man
must be taken impliedly to be answerable for what he knows
to be the ordinary consequence of what he permits.”...
At the same time, the case of <i>Somerset</i> v. <i>Hart</i><a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c015'><sup>[371]</sup></a> shows
that if actual knowledge be not proved, it must be shown
that defendant wilfully shut his eyes, or connived at what
was going on.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Person using.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Persons using the same for illegal betting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two questions arise here:</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>a.</i>) What amounts to “user”?</p>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b.</i>) Who is the “person using.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>User.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>(<i>a.</i>) As to what amounts to user, the following cases seem
to show that it is not necessary to show that a place
is habitually used for illegal betting; and that one or two
instances proved will be enough to enable the case to be
decided as a question of fact by the magistrates or the jury.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A club.</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus the case of <i>Oldham</i> v. <i>Ramsden</i><a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c015'><sup>[372]</sup></a> goes to show how
far a club at which betting is extensively practised, and in
which there was a separate room kept for betting purposes,
comes within the Act. Plaintiff was commission agent, and
in the habit of making bets for other persons: he was also a
member of a club at Manchester called “the Ellesmere,”
which consisted of over 1,400 members. It had one room in
which betting took place, and in the others were refreshments
and cards. In the betting room the bets were only
made between members, and no money was paid by way of
deposit. The defendant, who was not a member, employed
the plaintiff to back certain horses at certain races. The
plaintiff did so by taking the odds against these horses with
members of the club, and he informed the defendant of the
bets having been so made. The horses lost, and plaintiff
having paid the losses sought to recover from defendant.
The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff paid the money to
and it was received by the owner, occupier or keeper of a
certain house, office, room or other place opened, kept and
used for the purpose of money being received upon an
undertaking to pay money on the event of horse-races by
the owner, &#38;c., as the plaintiff well knew, and that the
money was paid by the plaintiff to such owner, &#38;c., for
the purposes of betting, or on a deposit on a bet. This
plea was evidently framed in the provisions of section 1 of
the Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only point really decided was whether this club was
a place used and kept by the owner or occupier for the
purposes of betting.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the plaintiff (supporting, of course, the legality of the
establishment), it was argued that it was not shown that any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>money was paid to the owner or occupier in respect of these
bets. The plaintiff was not owner; it was only one member
betting with another.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the defendant, on the other hand, that it was sufficient
that money was received by “persons using the same,”
which words did not mean persons acting on behalf of the
proprietor. Also that the members were “occupiers” of
the club within the Act, so that the receipt by one member
from another in respect of a bet would bring the case within
the Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>One member gave evidence that he made a bet with
plaintiff, and was paid by him at the club.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court held that there was no evidence that this
was a place kept or used for the purposes of betting.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be observed that this was a very concrete decision
and did not go far towards explaining what cases are and
what cases are not within the Act.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Enclosures.</div>

<p class='c007'>An enclosed ground may be “used for purposes of
betting” if betting men are allowed to enter and bet
indiscriminately with those resorting thereto. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Eastwood</i> v.
<i>Miller</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus in
<i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i><a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c015'><sup>[373]</sup></a> an officer went to the borough park
ground at Dewsbury, which was (it was admitted) in the
occupation of the defendant. A pigeon-shooting match was
about to take place. There were two bookmakers on the
ground shouting out 20 to 2 on the match. Two persons
went up to one of the bookmakers and made a bet, receiving
tickets in exchange. Defendant was within hearing of the
bookmakers, but did not take any part or say anything.
After the pigeon-shooting match a foot-race took place at
which bets were made as before on the pigeon-shooting.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was objected that there was no evidence that the grounds
were kept or used for the purposes of betting, as only one bet
was proved to have been made. But the Court held that
there was sufficient evidence to justify the magistrates in
coming to the conclusion that the premises were used for
betting as well as pigeon-shooting, and that the two objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>were combined. Defendant knew that persons going there
would bet upon the matches, and they were allowed to bet
there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Haigh</i> v. <i>Sheffield</i></div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Haigh</i> v. <i>Town Council of Sheffield</i><a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c015'><sup>[374]</sup></a> defendant occupied
a house, and an enclosed piece of ground adjoining, used for
cricket, foot-races, &#38;c. Within the grounds, but outside the
space reserved for the runners, and amongst the spectators,
some fifteen or twenty persons, being clearly professional
betters (George Trickett being one of them), stood on chairs
and stools in different spots, with books in their hands,
calling out the odds on the different runners and betting
with different persons. Numerous bets were made by the
visitors to the grounds, such persons each depositing one
shilling and receiving a ticket. It was admitted that the
defendant knew what was going on, and took no steps to
prevent it. Upon the question whether defendant could be
convicted of keeping or using the place for the purpose of
betting, <span class='sc'>Blackburn, J.</span>, said: “The appellant keeps the
grounds for both purposes (foot-racing and betting); and it
is immaterial which purpose is ancillary to the other. Then
it was said the place was not shown to have been ‘habitually’
used for betting: the word does not occur in the statutes;
but I think, if it were necessary to show it, there was ample
evidence from which the conclusion might be drawn, that it
was habitually used; and, moreover, I am of opinion, though
the magistrate would not probably have found that the place
was ‘used’ for betting if only one instance of betting had
been proved, still, if the occupier of the place, knowing that
betting was going on in this way, though only once, allowed
it to be carried on, he would be guilty of permitting the
place to be used for betting within the statute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the same effect is <i>Foote</i> v. <i>Buttler</i>,<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c015'><sup>[375]</sup></a> where the landlord
of an inn was proved only to have made occasional bets with
other people, the Court held that there was sufficient evidence
in which the magistrates might find, as a fact, that it was
used as a betting house.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>On the other hand, in <i>Whitehurst</i> v. <i>Fincher</i>,<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c015'><sup>[376]</sup></a> the defendant
was proved on some few occasions to have gone to the
bar of a public house, and to have made bets with persons
there<a href='#f376' class='c015'><sup>[376]</sup></a>; but it did not appear that he was a professional bookmaker.
The Court held that the mere making of bets was
not “user” within the Act, as it did not appear that he made
a business of betting with persons who resorted there.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Person using.</div>

<p class='c007'>(<i>b.</i>) As to who is included in the term “person using the
same,” the question was raised in <i>Oldham</i> v. <i>Ramsden</i>,<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c015'><sup>[377]</sup></a>
as to whether it did not mean “using as owner or occupier.”
<span class='sc'>Coleridge, C.J.</span>, rather suggested that that was so. The
same view seems to have been argued in the case of <i>Snow</i> v.
<i>Hill</i>,<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c015'><sup>[378]</sup></a> and if correct would have the effect of limiting the
application of the Act to persons who use a place by virtue
of a tenancy or legal right. It is, however, submitted, that
the wording of the statute precludes such a construction,
which would reduce the words “person using the same”
to mere surplusage<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c015'><sup>[379]</sup></a>. It is significant that the words are
omitted from the offence of “permitting, &#38;c.,” and also from
section 4, of which further mention will be made hereafter.
But while it would seem to be clear that “the person using
the same” may be a person who is a mere trespasser, it is
equally clear that he must be a person who is using it for
the illegal businesses specified: the “persons resorting
thereto” for the purpose of betting are not within the
Act, as was pointed out by <span class='sc'>A. L. Smith, J.</span>, in <i>Snow</i> v. <i>Hill</i>,<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c015'><sup>[380]</sup></a>
see, too, <i>Jenks</i> v. <i>Turpin</i>,<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c015'><sup>[381]</sup></a> where the same learned judge put
a like construction on somewhat similar words in the Gaming
House Act, 17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38, s. 4.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Manager.</div>

<p class='c007'>(3.) The next person whom the statute makes liable is the
manager or person assisting in the conduct of the illegal
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Slatter</i> v. <i>Bailey</i><a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c015'><sup>[382]</sup></a> the house was kept by T and his
two sons for the purpose of betting on horse-races. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>day T and one son sat at one table in a room receiving bets,
and in another room defendant and another son of T sat at
another table also receiving bets, the betting being called
out aloud. On the defendant, when apprehended, were found
numerous entries relating to past and future races. <i>Held</i>,
that as defendant was proved to have been assisting the
principal in the business, that was evidence that he was
using the house, and was taking part in the management
within the Act.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Club Committee.</div>

<p class='c007'>It will be remembered that in <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i>,<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c015'><sup>[383]</sup></a> the committee
of a club was held liable as having the management
of the business.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Cook</i>.</div>

<p class='c007'>In the late case of <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Cook</i>,<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c015'><sup>[384]</sup></a> before <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span> and
<span class='sc'>A. L. Smith, JJ.,</span> defendant was convicted by justices for
that he unlawfully had the care and management of a certain
cricket ground opened and kept for the purpose of persons
betting thereon, on certain events and contingencies relating
to a bicycle race. He was merely the manager employed
by the directors of a company. At a bicycle race betting
men were in the grounds among 20,000 people, and they
took down bets, and the odds were called out in a loud
voice. Cook acted as judge of the race, and stood about
twenty yards off from where the betting went on. Boards
were put up that no betting would be allowed. The appellant
knew there was betting though not taking part in it,
but he could not have wholly prevented it, though with the
aid of some constables he might have to some extent done so.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Form of conviction.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, said, in giving judgment, that the conviction
itself disclosed no offence at law. Defendant was convicted
of having had the care and management of a certain place
used for the purpose of other persons betting therein. This
would include ordinary betting, which was not interfered
with by the statute, as his lordship in the course of his
judgment explains. Dealing then with the facts proved in
the case, his lordship said that they did not bring the case
within the statute. Before the Act of 1853 there existed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>in London and elsewhere a number of offices and houses in
which a regular betting business was carried on, sometimes
conducted by the owners and occupiers, sometimes entrusted
to the care and management of clerks and servants. The
method of business was to keep long lists of races about to
take place, with the current odds placarded in the office, and
the owner or manager received ready money from all sorts
of persons to abide the event. This was what the Legislature
designed to prevent. So much for betting houses,
which are declared to be a common nuisance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 3, however, is directed against certain individuals—owners,
occupiers, and persons using the premises for the
purposes mentioned—persons permitting them to be so used,
and managers of the premises so used. In this case the
management by the defendant was perfectly lawful. The
Act only contemplates a taking a part or share in the
management of an unlawful part of the business. His
lordship was far from saying that no offence was committed
on the grounds. There were clearly men on the grounds
for both of the illegal purposes of betting mentioned in
section 1. If these men went down to this place for the
purpose of betting with persons resorting thereto, or even if
they limited their operations to receiving money on deposit,
they could be made responsible; there is ample evidence
that those men used the grounds for both these purposes.
Defendant did nothing but manage the lawful part of the
business; and the mere knowledge that betting of an illegal
character did take place in some part of the grounds, shows
no offence within the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Justice <span class='sc'>A. L. Smith</span> said that if the manager of the
grounds were held liable, it would be difficult to see how
any man employed to sweep the paths at Lillie Bridge could
escape responsibility if betting were proved to go on there.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. What kind of betting is within the Act?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Illegal betting.</div>

<p class='c007'>The Act prohibits two kinds of transactions:—</p>

<p class='c017'>(1.) Betting with persons resorting thereto;</p>

<p class='c017'>(2.) Receiving money on deposit or ready money
betting.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>(1.) With respect to the kind of betting that is within
the Act considerable uncertainty has always been felt owing
to the lack of decisions on the subject. In the above case
of <i>Haigh</i> v. <i>Sheffield</i> it was observed by <span class='sc'>Lush, J.</span>, that the
statute was intended to deal, not with the ordinary practice
of betting or wagering, but with a more degenerate form of
gambling, and one of a more demoralizing tendency. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Betting with
persons
resorting
thereto.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At
the same time his lordship does not explain exactly what
kind of betting is affected by the statute. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Oldham</i> v.
<i>Ramsden</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A case which
really does throw some light on the matter is <i>Oldham</i> v.
<i>Ramsden</i>,<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c015'><sup>[385]</sup></a> though the grounds of the decision are not very
clear. But it was there held that a club where the members
habitually bet with one another is not within the Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very common to hear the question asked, why is
Tattersall’s, &#38;c., tolerated when the betting houses are suppressed?
Two suggestions which have been made are worthy
of notice:—</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>a.</i>) That the Act does not apply to <i><span lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> clubs
limited in numbers where the members are selected in
the usual way. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Private clubs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It would seem, however, that since the
decision in <i>Jenks</i> v. <i>Turpin</i>, that a club or private house
may be a common gaming house that this distinction
is not sound, and that the suggestions in <i>Crockford</i> v.
<i>Maidenhead</i><a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c015'><sup>[386]</sup></a> must be considered as overrated.</p>

<p class='c017'>(<i>b.</i>) The other and most general impression is that
the Act does not apply except to ready money betting.
The principal judicial dictum which gives colour to this
view is that of Mr. Justice <span class='sc'>Blackburn</span> in <i>Haigh</i> v.
<i>Sheffield</i>,<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c015'><sup>[387]</sup></a> where he expressly leaves the question open
whether the place must not, to be within the Act, be kept
for the purpose of the particular kind of betting mentioned
in the preamble to the Act, viz., receiving money
on deposit.<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c015'><sup>[388]</sup></a> Anyhow, in this case, as in <i>Bows</i> v. <i>Fenwick</i>
and <i>Eastwood</i> v. <i>Miller</i>, there was evidence of deposits
having been paid. “It may well be,” said his lordship
“that the Legislature intended to confine it to that kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of betting, leaving it to future legislation to extend the
enactment if necessary.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Act not confined to ready money betting.</div>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, submitted that this is not the correct view
of the matter. The Act speaks not only of receiving money
on deposit but of “betting with persons resorting thereto.”
The real meaning of these words is betting indiscriminately
with all comers, that is to say, where in any place, house, or
club one or a limited number of persons are the centre of
every betting transaction that takes place, or, so to speak
“hold the hat” against all the rest, that is a species of
betting that the law prohibits, whether money passes at the
time of making the bet or not. That this was the intention
of the Act was clear from the speech of Sir Alexander
Cockburn in bringing the Bill before the House of Commons.<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c015'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Tattersall’s
not within
the Act.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was not, he said, intended to interfere with Tattersall’s
and such like places, where persons met and <i>bet amongst
one another</i>—where anyone is free to bet with anyone else.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is remarkable that this question has never been practically
dealt with in a Court of Law; nobody has ever yet
tested the legality of Tattersall’s or similar clubs. There
are, however, several dicta which give support to the view
here suggested. Thus in <i>Bows</i> v. <i>Fenwick</i>, L.R., 9 C.P., at
p. 344, <span class='sc'>Coleridge, C. J.</span>, observes: “It was an ascertained
spot where the appellant carried on the business of betting
with all persons who might resort there for that purpose.”
<span class='sc'>Brett, J.</span>, at p. 346, says: “It was a fixed place selected and
fixed upon by the appellant for persons who desired to deal
with him.” In <i>Galloway</i> v. <i>Maries</i>, 8 Q.B.D., at p. 281,
<span class='sc'>Grove, J.</span>, says: “There must be a fixed ascertained place
occupied or used so far permanently that people may know
that there is a person who stands in a particular spot
indicated by a definite mark with whom they may bet;”
and again, at p. 282: “The object of this Act was to
prevent persons having fixed localities to which other
persons may resort for the purpose of betting.” In <i>Hornsby</i>
v. <i>Raggett</i>, 1891 2 Q.B.D., at p. 24, <span class='sc'>Smith, J.</span>, says: “The
Act was intended to suppress the operations of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>persons who keep what may be described as “banks” for
the purpose of inducing other people to make bets with
them.”<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c015'><sup>[390]</sup></a> It seems a fact that in the clubs, the frequenters
are all on the same footing. In the illegal houses they
are divided into two classifications: (1) the persons who
form the market for betting; (2) those who go there to
bet with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A point may arise which has not yet been decided,
whether the Act in speaking of betting relates only to
betting on horse races, &#38;c., or whether it also includes
betting of every kind, such as betting on the price of stocks
as has been pointed out in the chapter on the Stock Exchange.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bucket shops.</div>

<p class='c007'>Proceedings of this kind for what are called difference
bargains are not infrequent in the “bucket shops”; does
then the Act apply to these “bucket shops”<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c015'><sup>[391]</sup></a> where difference
bargains are the course of business?</p>

<p class='c007'>The draftsmanship of the Act is curious, it speaks of
two illegal purposes, thereby following the preamble:
(1) betting with persons resorting thereto seemingly without
limiting the betting to horse races; (2) receiving money
on deposit on the event of horse races, &#38;c., so that as far as
ready money betting goes, the “bucket shops” are clearly
not within the Act. It is submitted that in speaking of
betting the Act cannot be held to limit it to betting on
horse races, and that such limitation is confined to the
case dealt with in the second clause of the section, viz., the
ready money bet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Betting by correspondence.</div>

<p class='c007'>A further point arises on the wording of this very difficult
statute within the first clause of the section, that is betting
generally as distinguished from ready money betting. The
words of the Act require that there should be: (<i>a</i>) Persons
who resort thereto; (<i>b</i>) definite betting with them by the
persons specified. Suppose, then, a bookmaker does business
with his clients by correspondence, does he come within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Act? Can his correspondents be said to resort thereto?
And the same question arises where betting is done by telephone.
It is submitted that these persons cannot be said
to resort thereto. To hold that they do, would be an
artificial and strained construction of the Act. This clause
of the section differs from the second relating to ready
money betting, in which “persons resorting thereto” are
not mentioned. It might well be that the framers of the
Act desired, to put down, not betting generally, but
establishments which form the nucleus of a crowd of
disorderly persons, which in the language of Bacon’s
Abridgment “cannot be but very inconvenient to the
neighbourhood.” The prohibitions against ready money
betting are more general as being productive of a greater
amount of criminality amongst clerks and servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true view seems to be that the bet must be made with
the person as and when he physically resorts thereto. If a
man sent his agent to the place no doubt the agent would
resort thereto, but it would seem that this would not bring
the bookmaker within the Act, unless the agent were
authorized to conclude the bet. In the case of betting by
correspondence, not only does the man send no agent there,
but the bet is certainly not made on the premises.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be admitted that this view makes the prohibitions
of the Betting House Act far less stringent than is usually
supposed, and this is the more especially so since the
decision in <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Stephenson</i> (this is dealt with <i>post</i> in the
observations as to ready money betting) which seems to
make it clear that by opening a banking account where
persons can deposit money in respect of bets which they
contemplate making, a bookmaker would not infringe the
second clause of the section. <i>Post</i> p. 190.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the greater part of the betting in this country is
carried on through commission agents who belong to Tattersall’s
or some other betting club, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Commission
agents not
within the
Act.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and do commissions
thereat for their clients. This transaction clearly does not
come within the Act (that is, unless, as we shall show
afterwards, he takes money in advance) as he does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>bet himself. Of course, if he were really the principal, and
did all the bets himself, he would be liable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Coupons.</div>

<p class='c007'>A question has more than once been suggested to the
writer as to the legality of a practice now very common
among the sporting papers of attaching coupons on which
are to be written, say, the winners of any three coming
events, a prize being awarded to the successful person or
persons. Is this a bet? If it is, then probably the proprietors
of the newspapers would lay themselves open to be
prosecuted for keeping an office for the purpose of betting
with persons resorting thereto. But it is submitted that
such a transaction is not in the nature of a bet at all. Even
supposing the purchaser of a newspaper get it at the office,
the 1d. or 2d. he pays is to buy the paper. Of course the
case might be different if a separate deposit was required when
the coupon is sent in. But the difficulty is all the greater
when, as is generally the case, the paper has been purchased
at an ordinary shop. There is then no privity between
the purchaser and the newspaper proprietors. We have
above (p. 32 <i><span lang="la">et seq.</span></i>) suggested some of the characteristics of a
wager: the coupon system does not seem to contain any of
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above observations have, since they were written,
been confirmed by the decision of the Divisional Court in
<i>Caminada</i> v. <i>Hulton</i><a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c015'><sup>[392]</sup></a>. The scheme in this case was of the
ordinary character. The defendant published “The Sporting
Chronicle Handicap Book” as a weekly companion to a
daily paper, “The Sporting Chronicle.” Attached to the
book, which was a sort of racing guide, was a coupon, with the
titles of six races printed on it. The book was sold for
1d., and the purchaser of the book was invited to fill up
the coupon with the names of the horses he might select
as the winners of the six races; and prizes of various
gradations were offered to the competitors, according to the
number of winners each might select. It was held that
the 1d. being paid for the purchase of the book, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>scheme was not a wager, but only a device for increasing
the sale: nor was it a deposit of money on an agreement
specified in section 3 of the Betting House Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case leaves the point suggested above untouched,
viz., whether if a separate payment were made in
respect of each coupon sent in, it would not amount to a
wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>Competitions have in modern times assumed very various
forms; but the racing coupon is the only one which has
evoked a decision. Each must be judged according to its
own scheme. Apart from fraud, the objections which could
be taken to them would be as infringements of the Betting
House Act in the Lottery Acts. In the earlier parts of
this work some tests and criteria of a “wager” and a
“lottery” are suggested. (See the Index under these
headings.)</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ready money betting.</div>

<p class='c007'>(2.) Receiving money on deposit. A house, &#38;c., kept for
this purpose is also illegal. No doubt all the cases cited
above as to evidence of a house being kept for the purpose
of the offence first mentioned in this section and of permitting
it to be so used are applicable to this case. The
following case shows that a man brings himself within the
statute by doing business in this way by correspondence,
even though he profess to be a mere agent for doing
commissions. It has already been suggested that betting
by correspondence is not within the first clause of the
section.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Wright</i> v. <i>Clarke</i><a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c015'><sup>[393]</sup></a> Wright was charged under section 3
of 16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119, with keeping a house and office near
Covent Garden for the purpose of receiving money on an
undertaking to pay money on events and contingencies
relative to horse races. Advertisements were inserted in the
different papers to the effect that he would execute commissions
on all races at the best prices, instructions to be
sent to his offices in York Street; that he did not lay bets
himself, but only acted as agent in the matter. “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>money sent for investment will be taken into the best
market, and laid out the best advantage for clients. All
communications must be sent through post, and the replies
can only be forwarded in the same manner. Commissions
executed to any amount on receipt of the cash. All bets
paid the day after the race (less 5 per cent. on winnings),
provided the vouchers are sent at the same time.” Two or
three police officers acting on instructions, gave instructions
to Wright by post to back certain horses for some of the
Ascot races, enclosing P.O.O.’s, and they received letters of
acknowledgment from Wright, saying that their instructions
had been carried out. In one case an officer received a
cheque from Wright for winnings minus 5 per cent., Wright’s
commission. A warrant being issued under section 11 of the
Act, Wright and some clerks engaged in filling up papers
and forms relating to his betting business were arrested.
A large number of documents and books relating to betting
were found upon the premises, and also 56,000 vouchers.
There was in one of Wright’s books an entry of his transaction
with one of the officers. Being convicted and fined
£100, a special case was stated for the Court of Queen’s
Bench.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Wright it was contended: (1.) That he was not
within the Act, seeing that persons did not resort to his
office, the whole was conducted by correspondence; besides,
he was simply an agent and not a principal. (2.) That the
vouchers did not amount to an agreement to pay money on
a bet, but only contained advice as to the mode of applying
for payment. (3.) If they did amount to such an agreement
the money deposited with him by P.O.O. was not the
consideration for such agreement. The real consideration
was the 5 per cent. of the winnings retained. (4.) That
Wright could not be said to have used the house for the
purpose of receiving the P.O.O.’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court held that Wright came within the second part
of section 1. The office was kept open and there was a
promise, express or implied, to pay the money in the event
of a horse race, though nobody entered the house. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>could be no doubt Wright was the principal and intended
to be responsible for the payment of the bet. An implied
promise would suffice to bring the case within the statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case seems to make it clear that the receipt of money
by way of deposit on bets even through the post is an
unlawful purpose within the second clause of sections
1 and 3, which do not speak of receiving money from
“persons resorting thereto.” It has already been suggested
that these words in the first clause seem to exclude making
bets on credit through the post. In the judgment of
<span class='sc'>Hawkins, J.</span>, in <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Preedie</i> (see note, p. 174), his
lordship says: “That the Act is directed against carrying
on the business of betting with, or receiving deposits from,
persons resorting thereto.” It is with the greatest deference
suggested, and for the reasons given above, that this is not
quite accurate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Taking cover in “bucket shops.”</div>

<p class='c007'>It has been suggested above that “bucket shops” would
be illegal under clause 1 of sections 1 and 3, if difference
bargains which have been held to be wager contracts, are the
course of business carried on therein. But as far as the
second clause goes relating to ready money betting, it is
clear that the bucket shops are not included, seeing that
these clauses are confined to ready money betting on horse
races, &#38;c., consequently they would not be liable under these
clauses for taking securities from their clients to secure the
differences they may have to pay, commonly known as
“cover.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Receipt must be in house.</div>

<p class='c007'>It has been held that in order to constitute a receipt
within sections 1 and 3, the actual receipt of the money
in respect of the bets must be in the house alleged to be used
for the unlawful purpose. In <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Stephenson</i><a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c015'><sup>[394]</sup></a> the bookmaker
used an alley, not part of the licensed premises, of
which the defendant was landlord, as a resort for persons
to bet with him, where he received sums of money on deposit.</p>

<p class='c007'>This money was afterwards taken into the defendant’s
house, and the house was it appeared used for the purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>settling. It was contended in support of the conviction that
this amounted to a continuous receipt by the bookmaker,
and that the defendant permitted the use of the
tavern as a betting office. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Banker not
liable.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Court held that the actual
receipt must be within the place alleged to be so used. It
is clear from this case that a banker could without liability
open an account for the receipt of deposits paid in by a
bookmakers’ customers in respect of bets which they contemplated
making with the bookmaker elsewhere, seeing
that the bank would not be used for an illegal betting
purpose by any of the persons specified. The effect of this
decision on the latitude allowed to bookmakers has been
pointed out above, p. 185.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Section 4.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 4 of the Act seems to aim at creating an offence
different from either of those specified in sections 1 and 3,
but the exact difference is not quite clear at first sight (the
section is set out at p. 166). The offence is any one actual
receipt or acknowledgment given in respect of a bet on a
horse race, &#38;c., by a person who keeps or manages a house
or place used for either of the purposes specified in sections
1 and 3. And it does not seem to be necessary that the
receipt should be in the house or place as it is under the two
earlier sections. But, of course, to constitute such receipt
an offence it must first be proved that there is a house or
place used, &#38;c.; section 5 giving a right to recover money
deposited as in the last section mentioned has been fully
dealt with at p. 65.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stakeholder of race meeting not liable.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 6 provides that the Act shall not apply to any
person receiving stakes to be awarded to the winner of a
race, &#38;c., so that the stakeholder of a race meeting is not
under any liability. The provision was no doubt considered
necessary seeing, as has been pointed out at p. 36, that a
race for stakes is really a wagering and gaming agreement
among the competitors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Agent liable for taking ready-money.</div>

<p class='c007'>Although, as we have seen, a person doing business as a
commission agent, and executing such commissions on
credit is not within the Act, yet it seems that if he take
money in advance he will be liable. Section 1 provides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that taking money as the consideration for securing the
payment <i>by another person</i> on any future contingency is an
illegal purpose. The text of the statute is given <i>ante</i>, p. 165.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Partnerships.</div>

<p class='c007'>We have <i>ante</i> p. 162 ventured the opinion that in a partnership
formed to carry on an illegal gaming house no
action could be maintained by one partner against the rest
for an account of profits. The same, of course, applies to
illegal betting houses, but subject to this, that in a betting
partnership it will be very material to see whether the firm
are really doing an illegal business at all; if the business be
simply that of betting at a lawful club, or if they do an
ordinary commission agency business, there is nothing illegal
in this, as we have just explained under the title of “illegal
betting.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Income Tax.</div>

<p class='c007'>Income Tax must be paid on profits even if the business
be illegal. <i>Partridge</i> v. <i>Mallandaine</i>, 18 Q. B. D., 276.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stewards’ authority in grand stand.</div>

<p class='c007'>Considering how the law stands with regard to the liability
of owners or occupiers of enclosures, for allowing them to be
used for the purpose of betting with the public resorting
thereto, it may be as well to notice that by law they have
somewhat arbitrary powers in the matter of allowing persons
to remain therein, even after they have paid their money.
Thus in <i>Wood</i> v. <i>Leadbitter</i>,<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c015'><sup>[395]</sup></a> Lord Eglinton was steward
of the Doncaster races. Plaintiff was in the grand stand,
having obtained admission by ticket issued by the authority
of Lord Eglinton. Defendant by his lordship’s direction
ordered plaintiff to leave the grand stand. It was assumed
for the purposes of the case that plaintiff had in no way
misconducted himself. It was held that the right to come
and remain on the land of another could only be granted
by deed; otherwise it was a mere license revocable at any
time without returning the money paid for the ticket.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Advertising betting houses.</div>

<p class='c007'>The next kind of offence created by the statute consists in
advertising any house or place as being used for betting
purposes or for the exhibition of betting lists.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119, sec. 7.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 7 enacts that “any person exhibiting, publishing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>or causing to be exhibited or published, any placard, handbill,
card, writing, sign or advertisement, that any house,
office, room or place is kept or used for the purpose of making
bets or wagers in manner aforesaid, or for the purpose of
exhibiting lists for betting, or for the purpose of inducing
any person to resort to such house, &#38;c., for the purpose of
making bets, or any person who on behalf of the owner or
occupier of such house, &#38;c., who shall invite other persons
to resort thereto for the purpose of betting, shall be liable
to a penalty of £50 or two months’ imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What persons are forbidden by this section to advertise
is: (1) That a house or place is kept for the kind of
betting mentioned in a former part of the Act, <i>i.e.</i>,
Section 1. So that to understand what kind of betting it is
that must not be advertised, reference must be made to the
cases that have been decided thereon. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Betting lists.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(2) People must not
advertise their houses as exhibiting betting lists—that is,
people may keep lists of races, current odds, &#38;c., but not
advertise the fact. This should be borne in mind by hotel
and club proprietors, and all persons whose premises are
furnished by means of the “tape” with the latest information
as to races. Betting lists may be seized by officers
entering premises by virtue of section 11 of 16 &#38; 17 Vict.,
which speaks of lists and “all documents relating to betting,”
and also they are expressly mentioned in section 12 of the
same Act, which treats of the powers of the Metropolitan
Police.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Act did not extend to Scotland.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 20, Scotland is expressly excluded from the
provisions of the Act, consequently not only was that country
inundated with members of the betting fraternity who could
not carry on their business in this country, but seeing that
betting houses in Scotland were not illegal, Section 7 did not
make advertisements of such places illegal. Consequently,
many of the daily papers made large sums by inserting
such advertisements, which, no doubt, acted as a powerful
incentive to certain members of the community to invest
their money across the border. As Mr. Anderson observed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>in bringing his Bill before the House of Commons,<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c015'><sup>[396]</sup></a> that
England had acted towards Scotland like the humane
gardener towards his neighbour by sending over to him all
his vermin. The Act which is known as Anderson’s Act,
37 Vict., c. 15, is described as “an Act to be construed as
one with the principal Act of 1853 and to be cited together
as the Betting Acts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Section 20 of the principal Act is repealed, thus extending
that Act to Scotland.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 3, when any letter, telegram, circular, placard,
handbill, card or advertisement is sent, exhibited or
published,</p>

<p class='c007'>(1.) Whereby it is made to appear that any person, either
in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, will, on application,
give information or advice for the purpose of, or with respect
to, any bet or wager on any such event or contingency as is
mentioned in the principal Act; or will make on behalf of
any other person any such bet or wager as is mentioned in
the principal Act; or</p>

<p class='c007'>(2.) With intent to induce any person to apply to any
house, office, room or place, or to any person with the view
of obtaining any information or advice for the purpose of
any such bet or wager, or with respect to any such event or
contingency as is mentioned in the principal Act; or</p>

<p class='c007'>(3.) Inviting any person to make or take any share in or
in connection with any such bet or wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every person sending, exhibiting or publishing, or causing
the same to be sent, exhibited or published, shall be subject
to the penalties provided in section 7 of the principal Act
with respect to offences under that section.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Tipsters’ business not prohibited.</div>

<p class='c007'>What the latter statute prohibits people doing is, not
advertising themselves as ready to give information or “tips”
with respect to ordinary betting transactions, but only with
respect to betting carried on in any office or place used for
the purpose of illegal betting within the principal Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Andrews</i><a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c015'><sup>[397]</sup></a> defendant issued advertisements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>in the <cite>Licensed Victuallers’ Gazette and Hotel Courier</cite> that
Centaur would, for half-a-crown in stamps, give information
and advice with respect to the probable winners of races in
the ensuing week. Centaur was the defendant’s regular
correspondent with respect to horse-races and information
relating thereto. There was no address given at which
persons desiring such information should apply. <i>Held</i>, that
the advertisement, contemplated in 37 Vict., c. 15, referred
to bets made in any office, house or place as referred to in
the principal Act, and not to advice with respect to ordinary
betting; the Act was to be read with the principal Act, and
the only kind of betting prohibited by the latter was that
specified in section 1. Of course, this being the purport of
the statute, all the cases cited above as to what is a “place,”
etc., and particularly as to the kind of betting prohibited by
the Statute 16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119, apply to the construction
of the supplementary as well as of the principal Act. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Betting clubs.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It
is clear, therefore, that the ordinary betting clubs so long as
they themselves are not within the Act, may advertise for
members. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Agents.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So also the ordinary commission agent, who does
business at these clubs, may advertise for clients.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Foreign houses.</div>

<p class='c007'>Now that the bookmaker, having first been driven out of
England has also been banished from Scotland, he seems
from the advertisements in the papers to have betaken himself
to Boulogne. Considering that any house he may set
up there is not within the Act, it follows that these advertisements
are perfectly legal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Betting and Loans (Infants) Act.</div>

<p class='c007'>We have now to notice an Act which has recently been
passed to prohibit the sending of advertisements or invitations
to bet to persons under age. The Betting and Loans
(Infants) Act, 55 Vict., c. 4, s. 1, provides: (1) “If any one
for the purpose of earning commission, reward, or other
profit, sends or causes to be sent to a person whom he knows
to be an infant, any circular, notice, advertisement, letters,
telegram or other document which invites, or may reasonably
be implied to invite, the person receiving it to make any
bet or wager, or to enter into or take any share or interest
in any betting or wagering transaction, or to apply to any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>person or at any place with a view to obtaining information
or advice for the purpose of any bet or wager, or for
information as to any race, fight, game, sport, or other contingency
upon which betting or wagering is usually carried
on, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour....” The
penalties imposed are, if convicted on indictment, three
months’ imprisonment, with or without hard labour, and
a fine of £100; on summary conviction, one month and
£20 fine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sub-section 2. “If any such circular, notice, advertisement,
letter, telegram or other document, as in this section
mentioned, names or refers to any one as a person to whom
any payment may be made, or from whom information may
be obtained for the purpose of or in relation to betting or
wagering, the person so named or referred to shall be deemed
to have sent, or caused to be sent, such document as aforesaid,
unless he proves that he had not consented to be so
named, and that he was not in any way party to, and was
wholly ignorant of, the sending of such document.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 3: If any such circular, &#38;c., is sent “to any
person at any university, college, school, or other place of
education, and such person is an infant, the person sending
it, or causing it to be sent, shall be deemed to have known
that such person was an infant, unless he proves that he
had reasonable grounds for believing such person to be of
full age.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 6: “In any proceeding against any person
under this Act, such person and his wife, or husband, as the
case may be, may, if such person thinks fit, be called, sworn,
examined, and cross-examined as an ordinary witness in
the case.” Scotland is not excluded from the Act.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Welshing.</div>

<p class='c007'>The oft-disputed question of whether “welshing” is a
penal offence has been set at rest by <i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Buckmaster</i>.<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c015'><sup>[398]</sup></a>
It was there held that it amounted to larceny by trick, on
the ground that there being no intention on the prisoner’s
part when he took the prosecutor’s money of paying the
prosecutor if he won his bet, there was no real contract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>between the two which could pass the property in the money
paid by the prosecutor to the prisoner.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>PROCEDURE.</h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Procedure.</div>

<p class='c007'>We now come to treat of the procedure whereby the laws
against gaming and betting houses can be enforced. It will
be observed that it differs in some important respects from
the ordinary procedure in criminal cases, in being more
drastic and to a great extent less considerate to the liberty
of the subject owing to the great difficulty of detecting the
offences and the facility with which the law might be evaded
if ordinary forms had to be observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The procedure is slightly different in the case of gaming
and betting houses, so they must be treated separately.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gaming houses.</div>

<p class='c007'>I. As to gaming houses, by 25 George II., c. 36, ss. 5
and 6, it was provided that if any two inhabitants of a
parish should give notice to a constable of any person
keeping a gaming house, the constable should take such
persons before a justice of the peace; that the justice
should, on the sworn information of such persons, bind them
over to prosecute at the Assizes or Sessions, and issue a
warrant for the arrest of the person accused and bind him
over to answer any indictment that might be found against
him. It seems that the section leaves the magistrate no
discretion as to granting a warrant<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c015'><sup>[399]</sup></a>; but as it only applies
to proceedings preliminary to indictments it is, in practice,
superseded by the procedure prescribed in the more
modern Statutes. This procedure is different according
as the house is situated in the Metropolis or out of that
district. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>In the
Metropolis.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the Metropolis, by 2 &#38; 3 Vict. c. 47, section
48, power was given to the Commissioners of the Police
Force, on the report of any superintendent, that there were
good grounds for believing that any house within the
district was used as a common gaming house, and on two
witnesses making oath before a magistrate, to empower the
superintendent and other constables to enter the house, arrest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>all persons found therein,<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c015'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and destroy all tables, instruments
of gaming, money, and securities for money. By 8 &#38; 9
Vict., c. 109, section 6, the Commissioners are invested with
the same powers, except that the necessity of two witnesses
making oath before a magistrate is dispensed with; and the
power to seize (and not destroy) instruments of gaming is
given.</p>

<p class='c007'>This latter section does not empower Metropolitan magistrates
to issue such warrant as the Betting House Act does.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In Ireland.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 24 of the latter Act, Metropolis in Ireland
means Dublin.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 7, special power is conferred on such superintendent
or constables to search the whole house where he
shall suspect there are instruments of gaming concealed, and
any person found therein,<a href='#f400' class='c015'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and to seize all tables and instruments
of gaming which he shall so find.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 8, magistrates before whom persons are
brought, having been arrested in a gaming house, may
order all such tables and instruments of gaming to be
destroyed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Out of the Metropolis.</div>

<p class='c007'>In the case of houses out of the Metropolis, justices of the
peace may, on information on oath that there is reason to
suspect any house is used as a gaming house, issue a warrant
in the form given in the schedule to the Act to empower
officers to enter such house by force, and arrest all persons
found therein. This section does not empower constables to
seize or destroy instruments of gaming. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Form of
warrant.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
An important point
to notice about the form of the warrant is that it is directed
only against a particular house, the individuals who may be
arrested need not be named or described. This is an important
departure from ordinary procedure, as generally a
warrant for an arrest is bad if the name of the person to be
arrested or some description of him do not appear on the face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of the warrant, as was decided in the “general warrant”
cases in George III.’s reign.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 5 it is provided that it shall not be necessary
in support of any information, for keeping a gaming house,
to prove that persons found playing therein were playing for
money or stakes.<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c015'><sup>[401]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The power of ordering the destruction of instruments of
gaming conferred by section 8 seems to apply out of the
Metropolis. The words are “warrant or order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It does not appear that police magistrates in the Metropolis
have the power of issuing warrants in the form above
described, as the section expressly excludes the metropolitan
district.</p>

<p class='c007'>N.B.—In any questions arising under this Act, reference
should be made to the cases which are noted under the
corresponding portions of the Betting House Act, as the
wording of the two statutes is in many cases similar.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evidence.</div>

<p class='c007'>There are also important provisions in 17 &#38; 18 Vict.,
c. 38, with respect to the power of a magistrate to compel
witnesses to give evidence, under section 5 and section 6. All
persons apprehended under the powers contained in section 3
and section 6 of 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109, may be required to give
evidence touching any unlawful gambling or obstruction of
officers in the house, notwithstanding that such evidence may
tend to criminate the witness. Such person refusing to be
sworn may be dealt with as any ordinary witness so refusing.
But every such person who has made full discovery of all
the facts he knows is entitled to a certificate from the justices
which frees him from criminal proceedings in respect of
matters on which he has been examined.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Levying and application of penalties.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 7 penalties and costs may be levied by distress,
and by section 8 half the penalty is to be paid in aid of the
poor-rate of the parish in which the offence is committed,
and half to the person laying the information.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Wray</i> v. <i>Ellis</i><a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c015'><sup>[402]</sup></a> a question arose as to whether this
section applied to penalties paid in the Metropolis. By the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Statute 2 &#38; 3 Vict., c. 71, section 47, it is provided that all
fines paid in London Police Courts shall be paid to the
Receiver of Police. The question was whether the enactment
was superseded by section 8 of 17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38.
The Court held that it was not; and that in the latter section
an implied exception was contained in the case of
penalties paid in the Metropolis, and that therefore the
Receiver was entitled.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Neglect to prosecute.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 9, if the person who shall have laid the information
neglects to prosecute, the justices may authorise some
other person to proceed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Appeal.</div>

<p class='c007'>Any person convicted summarily under this Act may
appeal to the Quarter Sessions on entering into recognisances
and finding sureties within 48 hours of his conviction.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No certiorari.</div>

<p class='c007'>By section 11 no information under the Act is to be
removed by certiorari into the Queen’s Bench.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Action against officers.</div>

<p class='c007'>In the case of actions brought against officers for any
trespass or other wrongful proceeding done or committed in
the execution of the Act, it is provided (section 13) that no
action shall be brought if sufficient tender of amends shall
have been made before action brought, and by section 14 no
action or other proceeding shall be brought, unless one
month’s notice in writing shall have been given to the
intended defendant, nor unless the action shall have been
commenced within three months of the act or omission
complained of.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Blake</i> v. <i>Beach</i><a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c015'><sup>[403]</sup></a> it was contended for the defendant
that by section 14 a month’s notice of the information ought
to have been given to him, but this point was abandoned by
Counsel as untenable, when the case came before the
Divisional Court; and was also said by the Court to have
been “founded on an obvious mistake!”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Vexatious indictments.</div>

<p class='c007'>Keeping a gambling house is one of the offences mentioned
in the Vexatious Indictments Act, 22 &#38; 23 Vict., c. 17,
which by section 1 provides that no bill of indictment for any
of the offences named shall be presented to the Grand Jury
unless the prosecutor or person preferring such indictment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>has been bound by recognisance to prosecute or give evidence;
though, by section 2, if the justices decline to commit for
trial, prosecutors may require them to bind him over to
prosecute.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Betting houses.</div>

<p class='c007'>The procedure in the case of betting houses is to a certain
extent similar to that in the case of gaming houses, except
that the power of magistrates to issue a warrant in the form
already described is not limited to places out of the metropolitan
district.</p>

<p class='c007'>By section 11 of 16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119, justices of the peace
are empowered, on information on oath that any house
suspected of being used as a betting house, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Search
warrant.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to issue a warrant
authorising the forcible entry into any such house, and the
arrest and searching of all persons found therein, and also
the seizure of all lists and cards and other documents relating
to racing or betting found in such house. Such warrant may
be in the form given in the schedule to 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Hume</i><a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c015'><sup>[404]</sup></a> it was decided (1) that this section
empowers the search of licensed houses as well as others,
although they are subject in some respects to special regulations;
(2) that the power to arrest persons found therein is
not confined to persons found engaged in gaming.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Blake</i> v. <i>Beach</i><a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c015'><sup>[405]</sup></a> a warrant was issued under section 11
of this Act for the search of a house suspected, as was stated
in the warrant, of being used as a common gaming house
within 8 &#38; 9 Vict., c. 109. Under this warrant defendant
and other persons found therein were arrested. Defendant
was afterwards charged under section 3 of 16 &#38; 17 Vict.,
c. 119, with keeping a betting house. Ample evidence was
given that defendant was manager of the place, and that it
was used for betting purposes, but this charge was made
without any fresh information being laid against defendant.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Whether
fresh information
necessary.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was objected on his behalf that as the information on
which the warrant was granted was laid under 8 &#38; 9 Vict.,
c. 109, a fresh information ought to have been issued before
he could be charged under the Statute of 16 &#38; 17 Vict.,
c. 119.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The Court differed, <span class='sc'>Field, J.</span>, holding that no fresh information
was necessary. In this case a specific charge was
made against the accused sufficient to give the magistrates
jurisdiction. The information provided for by section 11
took away the necessity of any further information. Further,
according to the current of modern authority, when a man is
before a magistrate who has jurisdiction as to time and place,
no further information is necessary before bringing any fresh
charge against him, though it might be proper to adjourn
the hearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of the Court, <span class='sc'>Cleasby</span> and <span class='sc'>Grove, JJ.</span>, differed.
In the ordinary course a charge is preceded by information
or summons. In this case the defendant was brought up on
a charge different from that contained in the information.
In a penal matter the charge ought to be comprised within
the information. There is nothing in section 11 to dispense
with the regular information or summons; it only enables
persons to be brought before the magistrates so as to know
who is to be charged. The conviction was therefore
quashed.<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c015'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The information may be laid before one justice only.<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c015'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Where an information under the Betting House Act
charged defendant with having kept a house for betting
purposes on the 5th October “and divers other days.”
The evidence proved the offence alleged on the 8th of
November only. <i>Held</i>, that under section 9 of 11 &#38; 12
Vict., c. 113, the variance was immaterial.<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c015'><sup>[408]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>For an instance in which a warrant was, under this section,
issued in the Metropolis, see <i>Clarke</i> v. <i>Wright</i> (quoted
above).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Powers of Commissioners of Police in Metropolis.</div>

<p class='c007'>Section 12 confers the same powers on the Commissioners
of Police in the Metropolis, on the report in writing of any
superintendent, to authorise such superintendent, with other
constables, to enter suspected betting houses, as is contained
in the Gaming House Act; to take into custody all persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>found therein,<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c015'><sup>[409]</sup></a> and to seize all lists, cards, or other documents
relating to racing or betting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Act also contains provisions similar to those of the
Gaming House Act, with respect to appeals to Quarter
Sessions, certiorari, and limitations of action (see above,
p. 199).</p>

<h3 class='c016'>GAMING IN LICENSED PREMISES.</h3>

<div  class='c003'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Gaming.</div>

<p class='c007'>By 35 and 36 Vict., c 94, if any licensed person (1)
suffers any gaming or any unlawful game to be carried on
on his premises, (2) opens, uses, or suffers his house to be
opened or used in contravention of 16 &#38; 17 Vict., c. 119, he
is liable for the first offence to a penalty of £10, and for
every subsequent offence to a penalty of £20; the conviction
to be endorsed on such person’s license.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>I. Gaming. Knowledge of owner necessary.</div>

<p class='c007'>The following cases go to show how far actual or constructive
knowledge on the part of the owner of the premises
is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Redgate</i> v. <i>Haynes</i>,<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c015'><sup>[410]</sup></a> defendant was the landlady of an
hotel at Epsom; witnesses proved that three men and a
horse-trainer, a jockey, and an inhabitant of Newmarket,
were playing cards for money in the sitting room from
11 p.m. The defendant retired to bed, leaving the hall
porter in charge of the house. The latter closed the door
and retired to his chair in the parlour, at the farthest end
of the house. The usual place for such chair was in the
hall, and it was his duty to wait upon his guests in the
sitting room. From the Judgment delivered the following
rules may be extracted: (1) The defendant would not be
liable merely for the fact of gaming unless she knew of it
or connived at it. (2) In her absence she was responsible
for the conduct of those she left in charge. (3) The fact of
the porter moving his chair out of the way was some evidence
that he suffered or connived at what was going on, but the
judges declined to say whether they would have drawn the
same conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>In <i>Bosley</i> v. <i>Davies</i><a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c015'><sup>[411]</sup></a> there was evidence that persons
were playing at cards in the house, but none that the
manageress or the attendants knew that gaming was on.
One of the players deposed that all the brandies and sodas
were served before the playing commenced. The case was
sent back to the magistrates with an intimation of opinion
from the Court that some knowledge, actual or constructive,
or connivance on the part of the owner was necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Somerset</i> v. <i>Hart</i>,<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c015'><sup>[412]</sup></a> defendant was keeper of licensed
premises. On market day when the inn was very full, two
men began gambling with a mug and three nuts. It was
proved that the potman knew of gambling, but took no
steps to prevent it, nor did he communicate it to the
landlord, who was engaged serving customers at the bar.
<span class='sc'>Coleridge, C.J.</span>, in giving judgment, distinguished the case
of <i>Redgate</i> v. <i>Haynes</i>,<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c015'><sup>[413]</sup></a> on the ground that there the magistrates
thought there was evidence of connivance. <i>Mullins</i>
v. <i>Collins</i> was a case of serving a constable with liquor while
on duty; but there the liquor was served by a woman who
was probably defendant’s wife, to whom the management of
the business had been entrusted. Here the magistrates find
that there was no evidence that defendant had actual knowledge
of the gaming, or that the potman communicated it
to him, or that he wilfully shut his eyes to what was going
on. All the cases show that there must be something in
the nature of connivance. See, too, <i>ante</i> p. 175.</p>

<p class='c007'>The case of <i>Bond</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c015'><sup>[414]</sup></a> carried the matter somewhat
further. The defendant, a licensed victualler, had a skittle
alley attached to his premises, the management of which he
entrusted to a servant. It was proved that cards were
played for money in the alley, and that the servant was
cognisant of the fact, though the defendant was not. It
was held that, the landlord of licensed premises “suffered”
gaming to be carried on when there was connivance at it,
either on his own part or on the part of any servant in
charge of that part of the house where gaming went on.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is gaming within the Act?</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>To be within the act there must be either gaming for
money or playing some unlawful game. Thus in <i>Reg.</i> v.
<i>Ashton</i><a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c015'><sup>[415]</sup></a> (a case within 9 Geo. IV., c. 61, section 21) it was
held that playing at dominoes, but not for money, was
lawful, dominoes not being an unlawful game.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Danford</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c015'><sup>[416]</sup></a> the game of ten-pins, the losers
standing beer all round, was held to be within the Act.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Bew</i> v. <i>Harston</i>,<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c015'><sup>[417]</sup></a> a licensed person allowed to be played
on his premises a game called “puff and dart,” the object of
which is to hit a mark on a target with a small dart blown
through a tube. The players each contributed 2d. as
entrance money, the total sum so contributed being applied
to the purchase of a rabbit as a prize for the winners. <i>Held</i>
that he was rightly convicted of gaming on licensed
premises. Cockburn, C.J., doubted whether the term
“gaming” did not apply to games of chance alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Except for the doubts thus expressed in the last case, the
authorities seemed to be all one way, that playing for money,
even at a game exclusively of skill, is “gaming”: this
view has since been adopted in <i>Dyson</i> v. <i>Mason</i>.<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c015'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Card playing.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Patten</i> v. <i>Rymer</i><a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c015'><sup>[419]</sup></a> an innkeeper, whose license forbade
him to suffer gaming on his premises, was held liable under
9 George IV., c. 61, section 21, for playing cards for money
with his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although 37 &#38; 38 Vict., c. 49, permits licensed persons to
serve liquors to private friends after hours, there is nothing
in that act which justifies him in allowing the friends in his
house to play cards for money.<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c015'><sup>[420]</sup></a> Section 25 of the Act of
1872, which imposes a penalty on persons found in licensed
premises during prohibited hours for the purpose of being
served with liquor, does not extend to cases where they are
only playing cards or other games.<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c015'><sup>[421]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Unlawful games.</div>

<p class='c007'>As to what are unlawful games, see <i>ante</i> p. 152.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Money lent by publican for gaming cannot be recovered.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Foot</i> v. <i>Baker</i><a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c015'><sup>[422]</sup></a> it was held that money lent by a publican
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>for the purpose of gaming in his premises contrary to
his license cannot be recovered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>II. Using the house for betting.</div>

<p class='c007'>Reference should be made to the notes on “What is
Illegal Betting” in the chapter on Betting Houses. It would
seem, therefore, that there is no objection to a publican keeping
a room in his house for other people to bet in, in the
same way as betting is practised at the Clubs; but he
must not bet with his customers himself, nor allow anyone
else to use the house for the purpose of betting with all comers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Sim</i> v. <i>Page</i><a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c015'><sup>[423]</sup></a> it was held that licensed victuallers are
still liable to be proceeded against, under the Gaming and
Betting House Acts, notwithstanding this Statute see
section 59.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BETTING IN A PUBLIC PLACE.</h3>

<p class='c019'>By 5 George IV., c. 83, section 4, any person playing or
betting in any street, road, highway or other open or public
place, at or with any table or instrument of gaming, at any
game or pretended game of chance, shall be deemed a rogue
and vagabond.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Instruments of gaming.</div>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Watson</i> v. <i>Martin</i><a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c015'><sup>[424]</sup></a> it was held that tossing for halfpence
was not within the statute. To supplement this
defect in the statute, by 31 &#38; 32 Vict., c. 52, section 3, the
words “coin, card, token or other article used as an instrument
or means of such wagering or gaming,” are added so
as to include pitch and toss. But in <i>Hirst</i> v. <i>Molesbury</i><a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c015'><sup>[425]</sup></a> it
was held that the latter statute did not apply to a deposit of
money by a person in the hands of another, in a public
place, to abide the event of a wager.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c015'><sup>[426]</sup></a> defendant was on a race course, and
had a machine called a pari-mutuel. This machine had on
it numbers, beside each of which were three holes, and behind
these holes were figures which by a mechanical contrivance
were made to shift on the turning of a key, so that any
number from 0 to 999 would be exhibited behind these holes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>On the top of the machine was the word “total,” and beside
it were holes in which could be exhibited in similar manner
figures shifting on the turn of a key. The defendant appropriated
each of these numbers to designate a horse about to
run in a race. Any person who wished to bet on a particular
horse, deposited with the appellants half-a-crown, and
received a ticket with the number of the horse. The defendants
then by a turn of the key altered the figures, increasing
the sum indicated alongside that number by one, and the
same turn of the key increased the figure beside “total” by
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the race had been run, the holders of tickets with
the numbers of the winning horse had divided among them
all the half-crowns deposited, less 10 per cent. which defendants
retained as their profit.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Held</i> (1) That this was an instrument of wagering or
gaming within the Act. (2) That as the amount to be won
depended on an event other than the issue of the race (<i>i.e.</i>,
it varied according to the number of persons who backed a
particular horse), it was a game of chance. It was like a
lottery, which (<i>semble</i> at p. 514) would be a game of chance
within the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was left open whether a horse-race was a game of
chance (but see <i>post</i> as to games of chance).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is a public place?</div>

<p class='c007'>An <i>omnibus</i><a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c015'><sup>[427]</sup></a> is a public place at any rate for some
purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Turnbull</i> v. <i>Appleton</i>,<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c015'><sup>[428]</sup></a> colliers and their families were
allowed by a company to use a large field of 30 acres for
recreation. Strangers were also allowed to go and play
there. On one occasion defendant played pitch and toss
in the field. <i>Held</i> that this field was a place to which the
public had access.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has lately been decided that <i>a railway carriage</i> is a
public place while in the course of a journey.<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c015'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So, too, <i>a race course</i>. See <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Thomas</i> (<i><span lang="la">ubi sup.</span></i>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>36 &#38; 37 Vict., c. 94.</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>The Statute 36 &#38; 37 Vict., c. 94, repeals the Act of 1868
and provides “that any person playing or betting, by way
of wagering or gaming, in any street, road, highway or
other open and public place, or in any open place to which
they have or are permitted to have access, at or with any
table or instrument of gaming, or any coin, card, token or
other article used as an instrument or means of such wagering
or gaming, at any game or pretended game of chance,
shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond” within the meaning
of the Act of George IV., and punished under the provisions
of that Act (<i>i.e.</i>, three months’ imprisonment), or may be
fined 40s. for a first offence and £5 for a subsequent offence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would seem that this statute is wide enough to take in
a case like <i>Doggett</i> v. <i>Catterns</i><a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c015'><sup>[430]</sup></a>—where it will be remembered
a man had a table in Hyde Park for betting purposes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Games of chance.</div>

<p class='c007'>We have now to consider what really is comprehended in
the term “game of chance” as used in this Statute. The
writers are not aware that the exact term has been used in
any other statute, though the converse expression, “game of
skill,” is to be found in the Act of 1845. It is, however,
to be found in various cases such as <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i><a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c015'><sup>[431]</sup></a> and
<i>Dyson</i> v. <i>Mason</i><a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c015'><sup>[432]</sup></a> (see Table of Cases). In <i>Tollett</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>
(<i><span lang="la">ubi sup.</span></i>) that a pari-mutuel was an instrument of wagering
on a game of chance, although the owner was not betting
himself with the depositors on the ground, that the amount
which each depositor could win was a matter of uncertainty,
until it was finally ascertained how many in the total had
backed such depositor’s horse; the result being entirely
independent of his skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is submitted that the true test of whether or not a game
is a game of chance, including in the term a game partially
of skill and partially of chance is, whether according to the
rules or scheme of the game any material part of or step in
the game is determined by chance. But the term “chance”
must be used in a more definite and limited sense than
mere uncertainty, or even the possibility of uneven luck.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The idea of chance seems to be the same as that of lot, <i>e.g.</i>,
the dealing of cards, the throwing of dice, or the spinning
of a teetotum. Uncertainty is the essence of every game
even if of skill; and frequently inequality of luck is an
important factor. Thus in billiards or pool every stroke
is an effort of skill both as to the stroke itself and the placing
of the balls for next stroke; and probably (with ordinary
players) few games of skill are more influenced by luck;
yet in <i>Dyson</i> v. <i>Mason</i>, billiards was assumed on all sides to
be a game of skill. Again, the design and scheme of a horse-race
is a contest involving a trial of the speed and staying
power of the horses, and the skill and nerve of the jockeys;
though doubtless attended by uncertainties which need no
enlargement. Still, what was assumed in <i>Dyson</i> v. <i>Mason</i>
supports the view that mere uncertainty is not tantamount to
chance; and if so, the question which was reserved in <i>Tollett</i>
v. <i>Thomas</i>, viz.: whether or not horse-racing was a game of
chance must be answered in the negative.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In Metropolis.</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX A.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'><i>Higginson</i> v. <i>Simpson</i>, <i>ante</i> p. 36.—The author begs, with great respect, to
suggest that this decision is erroneous, and that the case is really within the
principal of <i>Beeston</i> v. <i>Beeston</i>, which, it will be remembered, decides that a
partner or agent is liable to account to his co-partner or principal for winnings
received on a betting transaction. The real nature of the agreement in the
present case seems to have been as follows:—The defendant, accepting the
plaintiff’s “tip,” backed the horse “Regal” at 25 to 1, laying, say £4 on him,
so that if the horse won, his winnings would be £100, of which he was to
account for £50 to plaintiff, while if the horse lost, plaintiff was to pay him
£2, <i>i.e.</i>, share the loss in the same proportion as the profit. The author submits
that this arrangement amounted to a partnership in a betting transaction
and nothing else—it was a contract to share profit and loss. Suppose plaintiff
had prepaid the £2 to defendant with instructions to back the horse on their
joint account, plaintiff to receive £50 as his share of the winnings, would not
that have been almost on all-fours with <i>Beeston</i> v. <i>Beeston</i>? Does, then, the
fact of there having been no prepayment make any difference? or the fact
that here the plaintiff was to win or lose a fixed sum, instead of a certain
proportion of the profits or losses? The real distinction would seem to be
between an independent wager between A and B and an agreement between
A and B with respect to profits and losses to be won or incurred by a wager
with a third party. The transaction in this case seems to come under the
latter category; it was not like a “hedging” operation on the part of the
defendant; it was not as if defendant had first made a wager with a third
party backing the horse, and then made a separate wager with plaintiff betting
against the horse, taking advantage, perhaps, of a change in the odds to cover
his risks. The agreement clearly had reference to a betting transaction to be
effected with a third party, and the plaintiff’s right to the £50 was clearly
conditional on the bet being made, on the horse winning, and, it would even
appear, on the defendant’s being paid what he won; plaintiff was to receive
£50 <i>out of the winnings</i>. It was not an unconditional, personal agreement to
pay on a future event.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt in form it was very like a wager between plaintiff and defendant,
plaintiff backing the horse for £2 at 25 to 1; but the cases cited in the text
seem fully to establish the principle, which was indeed accepted by the Court
in the present case, that it is the substance and not the form that is material.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>N.B.—There is a misprint in the “Law Report,” 2 C. P. D. 76, which would
give a totally different character to the transaction. The report reads, the
“<i>Defendant</i> was to pay £2 to the plaintiff.” It is clear from the arguments
and the judgment that it was the plaintiff who was to pay £2 to the
defendant.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>RULES ON BETTING.<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c015'><sup>[433]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c019'>Although the Stewards of the Jockey Club take no cognisance of betting,
yet, for the convenience of such persons as are interested in the subject,
we subjoin a copy of the Rules as re-arranged by the Committee of the
Subscription Rooms, at Tattersall’s, on February 8th, 1886.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The Committee of Tattersall’s and the Committee of the Newmarket
Rooms have authority to settle all questions relating to bets, to adjudicate on
all cases of default, and, <i>at their discretion</i>, to report defaulters and persons
guilty of any malpractice to the Jockey Club. In the following rules the
words “the Committee” refer to either of those bodies.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In all bets there must be a possibility to win when the bet is made:
“you cannot win when you cannot lose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>[On September 25th, 1890, the following addition was made to this rule].</p>

<p class='c007'>“No betting ‘first past the post’ will be recognised by either of the
Committees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For betting purposes, the time of starting for any race shall be decided in
accordance with Rule 38 of the Rules of Racing.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. All bets are <span class='fss'>P. P.</span>—play or pay—with the following exceptions—1. When
the nominator dies before the decision of the race. 2. When the race is
postponed to a future week, or the conditions are altered after the bets are
made. 3. Bets on matches. 4. Bets made after the running numbers are
telegraphed about a horse that is not subsequently under the starter’s orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. If no objection is lodged within seven days of the race, exclusive of the
day on which the race was won, bets go to the horse placed first by the Judge,
and the settling, except in cases of fraud, shall not be disturbed. If an
objection is made within the said time, bets go with stakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Bets made on one horse against another, or that one horse beats another,
are determined if either of them <i>should win</i>: unless agreed by the parties, it
is not indispensable that both horses should start. Bets made between horses
1, 2, 3 are determined by the places assigned by the Judge—it is not necessary
to say <i>the best</i> of 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>6. If odds are laid in running or immediately after the horses pass the post,
and a dead heat is the result: and in “double events,” if <i>either</i> is decided in
the backer’s favour, and the other results in a dead heat, the money betted
must be put together and equally divided. As, according to racing custom,
matches which result in a dead heat are void, bets are void also.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. If a bet is made on one of the horses that runs a dead heat against a
beaten horse, and the owners agree to divide, he who backed the horse that
ran the dead heat wins half his bet. If odds are laid on one horse against
another 1, 2, 3, and they run a dead heat for either place, the money betted
must be put together and equally divided.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The person who lays the odds has the right to choose a horse or the field;
when a person has chosen a horse, the field is what starts against him. If
odds are laid without mentioning the horse before the race is over, the bet
must be determined by the state of the odds at the time of making it.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Bets made after a race that the winner will be disqualified, stand, even
if no objection be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Any bet made from signal or indication when the race has been
determined shall be considered fraudulent and void.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. All bets on matches and private sweepstakes depending between any
two horses shall be void if those horses subsequently become the property of
the same person, or of his avowed confederate.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. Double event bets are determined when the first is lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. Bets made on horses winning any number of races within the year shall
be understood to mean between the 1st of January and the 31st of December.</p>

<p class='c007'>14. Money given to have a bet laid shall not be returned, though the race
be not run.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. Confirmed bets cannot be declared off except by mutual consent, but on
any allegation of fraud or corrupt practice, the Committee will investigate
the case and may declare the bet void. Either of the bettors may demand
stakes to be made on proving to the satisfaction of the Committee that he has
just cause for doing so. <i>If ordered</i>, the bets must be covered or sufficient
security offered, and a person refusing to cover shall be expelled the
Subscription Room at Newmarket and at Tattersall’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. The Committee will not <i>necessarily</i> enforce the settlement of a compromised
account. Before giving a decision they may require the books of
the debtor and a statement of his accounts to be submitted to them; but
they have authority, in all such cases, to order the account to be settled if they
think a reasonable offer is made.</p>

<p class='c007'>17. If a debtor does not satisfy the claims of his creditors within twelve
months, he shall not be entitled to receive any debts which may be due to him;
but if he does so within the prescribed time, viz., “one year,” <i>i.e.</i>, 365 days,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>inclusive of the day when the money was won, the Committee will support his
just claims to receive payment from his debtors.</p>

<p class='c007'>18. If any extraordinary occasion should arise, or in cases of notorious and
palpable fraud, any of the before-mentioned rules may be suspended by the
Committee.</p>

<p class='c007'>19. The Stewards of races have no authority <i><span lang="la">ex officio</span></i> to take cognisance of
any disputes or claims with respect to bets.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='C' class='c005'>APPENDIX C.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Since the observations on page 34 were written, the case of Carlill v.
The Smoke Ball Company (see daily papers, 5th July, 1892) has been decided
by Hawkins, J. The case can only be very shortly noticed here. The
contract was that the Defendants would, if any person after having used
their smoke ball for a given time should contract an attack of influenza, pay
such persons £100. The Defendants contended that this was a wager contract.
If tested by the light of the criteria suggested at page 34, it would
seem to be far removed from a wager. The consideration received by the
Defendants was the exploitation and experimenting by the Plaintiff of their
smoke ball; and it was only after that had become an accomplished fact—<i>a
certainty</i>—that they came under their conditional liability to the Plaintiffs.
The learned Judge enters into a discussion of the essentials of a wager contract,
on which the following observations may with deference be suggested:—(1)
The backing or expressing of an opinion is not essential, as suggested
at page 34. The man who is party to a wager selects a chance: an unknown
or uncertain event in which he is to receive payment.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) A wager involves the selection of more than one event, otherwise the
essential of mutuality is lost. Each party selects the event, positive or
negative, on which he is to be paid by the other. A backs a horse with B;
B of course may select the negative event that A’s horse will not win, or
what is the ordinary contract of “the layer,” he merely backs the field, <i>i.e.</i>,
all the other horses but A’s horse. It is quite possible in the latter case that
both events may happen, <i>e.g.</i>, A’s horse may run a dead heat with one of
the field. The rule here is that each party whose horse runs a dead heat wins
half his stake, or in other words the money is put together and evenly
divided. If A backed the horse at evens the bet is practically off; if he
backed it at 5 to 1 he wins £2. A walk over of course counts as a win to
the party whose horse walks over.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r400'>400</a>. A question was raised in <i>Turpin</i> v. <i>Jenks</i>, as to what was to be done
with the “persons found therein.” The answer seems to be that the power
is given to enable the officers to ascertain by inquiry how far these persons
were responsible for the gaming. See per Field, J., in <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Hume</i>, 46,
J.P. 825; besides, the Statute 17 &#38; 18 Vict., c. 38, compels these persons to
give their addresses. It would seem therefore that having given their
addresses they should be released until the police are in a position to make
a definite charge against them.</p>
